104 Non-:s To cATo MAIOR. [59.

potestas in Phil. 1, 3. — loquitur cum Critobulo etc.: ‘dis-
courses with Critobulus of how Cyrus etc.'. The construction of
loqui with acc. and inf. belongs to colloquial Latin, as does the con·
struction loqui aliquam rem for de aliqua re ‚· cf. Att. 1, 5, 6 mecum
Tadius locutus est te ita smpstlrse ; ib. 9, 13, 1 mera scelera loquuntur.
— Cyrum minorem: Cyrus the younger (cf. 79 Cyrus maior),
well known from Xenophon’s Anabasis. As Cyrus never arrived at
the throne (having been killed at Cunaxa in 401 in his attempt to oust
his brother the king with the help of the 10,ooo Greeks) regem is used
in the sense of ‘ prince '‚-as in Verr. 4, 61 and elsewhere; βασιλεύς is

’ used in exactly the same way in a passage of the Oeconomicus which

comes a little before the one Cic. is here rendering (4, 16). -— Ly-
sander: the great commander who in 405 Β. e. won the battle of
Aegospotamos ,against the Athenians. -- Sardis: acc. pl.; ·is repre-
sents Gk. -εις, — consaeptum agrum: ‘park’; the phrase is a
translation of Xenophon's παράδεισον ; this will account for the omis-
sion οἱ et before dilegenter consitum. — diligenter: ‘ carefully ’. —-
proceritates: the plural probably indicates the height of each kind

of tree. — quincuncem: thus: ····· This was the

order of battle in the Roman army during a great part of its history.
The cause for this application of the term is rather difficult to see3 it
originally meant five-twelftbs of an uncia ,· possibly it was thus ap-
plied because by drawing lines between the points the letter V (five)
might be produced. As regards its application to trees, see Verg.
Georg. 2, 277-284. —puram : so the sarmers talk of ‘ cleaning ’ the
land. — dimensa: notice the passive use of this participle, origi·
nally deponent; cs. n. on 4 adeptam. — discripta: ‘arranged ’ς so
dtis-eriphi) a little farther on. Cf. n. on 5 descriptae. — ornatum:
‘ costume '‚ used by Latin writers of any dress a little unfamiliar. So

in Plaut. Miles 4, 4, 41 (1177 R) ornatus nauclericus.
60. impedit: sc.= nos ; with this construction the pronoun is always

omitted. — Valerium: when a young man, in 349 Β. 0., he engaged
in combat with a Gaul, in sight of the Roman and Gallie armieS, and
came off victor by the aid of a raven, corvus,· hence the name Cor·
vinus (Liv. 7, 26). His first consulship was in 348, his last in 2993
Cic. has miscalculated. Valerius was also twice dictator and is said

 

to have held altogether 21 terms of curule offices. perduxisse:
sc. agri colendi studia. Cf. Lael. 33 quod —perdulecsena —— esset:
