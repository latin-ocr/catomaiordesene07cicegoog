During the whole of an exceptionally busy public life Cicero
devoted his spare moments to reading and to the society of the
learned. After his exile in 58 and 57 Β. c. his political career,
except for a brief period just before his death, was over, and it
is at this time that his period of great literary activity begins.
In 55 he ‘produced the-work De Oratore, in 34 the De Re Pub-
lica, and in 52 the De Legibus, all three works, according to
ancient ideaS, entitled to rank as philosophical. ¹

From 51 to 46 Β. c.‚ owing first to his absence in Cilicia, then
to the civil troubleS, Cicero almost ceased to write. But 1n the
latter year he was reconciled with Caesar, and as the Senate and
law courts were closed against him on his refusal to compromise
his political principleS, he betook himself with greater devotion
than ever to literature. The first work written in 46 was the
Hortensius, or De Philosophia, now lost. It was founded on a
lost dialogue of Aristotle, and set forth the advantages of study-
ing Philosophy. During the same year Cicero completed sev-
eral oratorical works, the Partitiones Oratoriae, the Brutus, or
De Claris Oratoribus, and the Orator, all of which are extant.

Early in 45 Cicero lost his beloved daughter Tullia. He
passed the whole year in retirement, trying to soothe his grief
by incessant writing. In quick succession appeared
De Consolatione, an attempt to apply philosophy to the mitiga-

tion of his own sorrow and that os others;

Academica, an exposition of the N ew Academic l3hilosophy,
advocating probability rather than certainty as the foundation
of philosophy3

De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum, a work criticising the most
prominent views entertained concerning Ethics;

Disputationes Tusculanae, treating of certain conditions essen-
tial to morality and happiness ;
