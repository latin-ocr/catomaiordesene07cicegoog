held the same rank, and shone by comparison with his blunder-
ing superior officers. Coming to Rome in 148 he stood for the
aedileship, but was elected consul for the year 147, and again for
146, when he finished the war. He is said to have grieved over
the fate of Carthage, and to have dreaded any further increase of
the Roman territory. In ¹42 Scipio was censor, and acted with
almost Catonian severity. In 134, though not a candidate, he
was elected to the consulship and put in command of the Roman
army then besieging the city of Numantia in Spain. The war, of
which this siege formed a part, had been going on for some years
most disastrously for the Romans, but Scipio speedily brought it
to a conclusion tn 133. While before Numantia he received news
of the murder of Ti. Gracchus, whose sister he had married and
whose cousin he had become by adoption, but whose policy he
had on the whole opposed, though he had occasionally coquet·
ted with the democrats. This course cost him the favor of the
people, and when in 131 he desired to conduct the war against
Aristonicus, only two of the thirty-five tribes voted for his ap-

pointment. In 129, after a violent scene in the senate, where he
had opposed the carrying out of Ti. Gracchus' agrarian law, he
was triumphantly escorted home by a crowd, composed chiefly
of Italians whose interests had been threatened by the law.
Next morning he was found dead in his bed. Opinion as to
the cause of his death was divided at the time and so remained.
In the Laelius the death is assumed to have been from natural
causes-¹ Elsewhere, however, Cicero adopts the view of many
of Scipio's friends that he was murdered by Carbo.⁸ Carbo
afterwards lent color to the suspicions by putting himself to
death, in order, as 'was supposed, to avoid a direct prosecution.
In ancient times even C. Gracchus was suspected of having thus
avenged his brother' s death, but no modern scholar of any rank
has countenanced the suspicion.

Whether the degree of intimacy between Cato and Scipio,
which Cicero assumes, ever existed or not, cannot be determined. ⁸
