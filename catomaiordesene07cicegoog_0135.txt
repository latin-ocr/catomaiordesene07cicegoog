53] NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. 99

in 6 (where see n.), 24, 56, 59, 82. —— requietem: the best MSS. ot
Cic. sometimes give the other form requiem, as in Arch. 13. — vim
ipsam : ⁸ the inherent energy ’. — omnium . . . terra: a common peri·
phrasis for ‘all plants ’ς cf. e. g. N. D. 2, 120. The Latin has no one
word to comprehend all vegetable products. -- quae . . . procreet:
‘able to generate '. -— tantulo: strictly elliptic, implying quantulum
re vera est. In such uses tantus and tantulus differ slightly from mag-
nus and parvum they are more emphatic. — acini vinaceo: ⁸ a
grapestone ’. — minutissimis: used here for minimis. Strictly
speaking minutus ought to be used of things which are fragments of
larger things, minutus being really the ,participle passive of minuo.
In a well-known passage (Orat. 94) Cic. himself calls attention to the
theoretical incorrectness of the use, which, however, is found through·
out Latin literature. Cf. 46 pocula minuta ,· also below, 8 5 minuti
philosophi. —— malleoli: vine—cuttings: so called because. a portion
of the parent stem was cut away with the new shoot, leaving the cut-
ting in the shape of a mallet. — plantae : ‘suckers’, shoots spring·
ing out of the trunk. — sarmenta: ‘scions’, shoots cut from
branches not from the trunk. — viviradices: ⁸ quicksets ’, new
plants formed by dividing the roots of the mother plant. —- propa-
gines : ‘layers ⁹, new plants formed by rooting a shoot in the earth
without severing it from the parent plant: Verg. Georg. 2, 26. —·
eadem: n. on 4 eandem. — claviculis: cf. N. D. 2, 120 -vites sic
claviculis —- ars agricolarum: agricolae arte fieti, a strong instance
of the abstract put for the concrete.

53. eis: sc. sarmentzlv, those which have not been pruned away by·
the knife. exsistit: ⁸ springs up ’. Exsistere in good Latin never
has the meaning of our ⁸ exist ’‚ i. e. ‘to be in existence ’, but always
means ‘to come into existence ’. — articulos: ⁸ joints ’ς cf. 51 culmo
geniculato. The word tamquam sottens the metapbor in arta-uli, which
would properly be used only of the joints in the limbs of animals. —
gemma: Cicero took the meaning ⁸ gem ' or ⁸ jewel ’ to be the primary
sense of gemma and considered that the application to a bud was
metaphorical. See the well-known passages, Orat. 81 and De Or. 3,
15 5. — vestita pampinis: ‘arrayed in the young foliage ’. ———
fructu ... aspectu: ablatives of respect, like gustatu above. -— ca-
pitum iugatio: ‘the linking together of their tops’; i. e. the uniting
of the tops of the stakes by crossstakes. So the editors: but Con·
ington on Verg. Georg. 2, 3 55 seems to take capita of the top-foliage
