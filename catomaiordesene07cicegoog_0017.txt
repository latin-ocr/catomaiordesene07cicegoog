forth in the treatise had given him real comfort‚¹ and the open-
ing words of the dedication show that he meant and hoped to
administer the same comfort to his friend AtticuS, who indeed
acknowledged the benefit he derived from the work.² When
Cicero wrote the treatise he was himself sixty·two years of age,
while his friend was three years older. He speakS, therefore,
rather euphemistically when he says that his purpose is to
lighten the trouble of an old age which is already close at hand,
or at all events approaching.³

But in addition to the main ethical purpose, there waS, as in
many of Cicero's works, a distinct political purpose. He
desired to stimulate in his readers an admiration for what he
regarded as the golden age of Roman politicS, the era of the
Punic wars, and to do this by making the contrast between that
age and his own appear as striking as possible. A like double
purpose is apparent throughout the De Re Publica, where Afri-
canus the younger is the chief personage, and in the treatise on
Friendship, where Laelius is the central figure. For the dia-
logue on Old Age M. Porcius Cato the Censor is selected as
the principal speaker for two reasons: first, because he was
renowned for the vigor of mind and body he displayed in ad-
vanced life 3 ⁴ and secondly‚ because in him were conspicuously
exhibited the serious simplicity, the unswerving adherence to
principle, and the sels-sacrificing patriotism which were the ideal

Roman virtueS, and which Cicero could not find among the poli-
ticians of his time.

is cast in the form of a dialogue. Among the ancients the dia-
