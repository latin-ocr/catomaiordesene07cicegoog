we live ’. difficilius dictu: ‘a harder saying '. The Latin like .
the English phrase is inaccurate‚ since the statement is not hard to
make, but hard to believe. Cf. Mark 2, 9 ‘Whether is it easier to
say to the sick of the palsy ...² Cic. often has incredibile daz-tu ; cf.
Liv. 3, 5, 12 defficile adfidem est affirmare. tantus eos honos:
