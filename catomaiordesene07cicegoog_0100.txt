64· NOTES To CATO MAIOR. [16

rhus. — accedebat ut: accedat is far oftener followed by a clause
with quod and indicative than by a clause with ut and subjunctive.
When the quod-clause follows», it contains a fact looked at merely
as a fact and nothing rnoreg but the ut-clause views the fact as conse·
quent upon, or dependent on some other fact. Here the blindness is
regarded as being the consequence οἱ old age ς though Livy 9, 29, 11
and other authors attribute it to the anger of the gods, because as
censor Appius had taken the administration of the worship of Her·
cules away from the ancient family of the Potitii, and had placed it in
the hands of public slaves. The mental vigor of Appius in his old
age is mentioned by Cic. in Tusc. 5, 112.

P. 8. - curn Pyrrho: note the position of the words between
pacem and foedus, with both of which they go. This usage is called
by the grammarians coniunctio ‚⁸ cf. n. on Lael. 8 cum summi viri tum
amicissimi ,⁰ also above, quae 1'uventute geruntur etviribus ,· below,
18 quae sint gerenda praescribo et quo modo. foedus: this
seems opposed to pacem as a formal engagement is to a mere absten-
tion from hostilities. non dubitavit dicere: when dubitare means
‘to hesitate ’ (about a course of action), and the sentence is negative,

 

 

' or an interrogative sentence assuming a negative answer, the infinitive

construction generally followS, as here3 but the infinitive is rare in
a positive sentence. When dubitare means to ‘be in doubt' (as to
whether certain statements are true or not), the regular construction
is either quin with subj. or some form of indirect interrogative clause.
Cf. below, 2 5. quo vobis: from the Annales. In mentes de·
mentis we have oxymoron (an intentional contradiction in terms) as
in 38 sensim sine sensu ,· 39 munus. . . aufert. On the case of vobis,

--- et tamen: the sense is incompletely expressed3 in full it is ‘and
yet there is no need for. me to refer to Appius' speech as given by
Ennius, since the speech itself is in existence ’. Exactly similar ellip
