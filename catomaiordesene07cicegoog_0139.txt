vitat atque allectatx one of the ‘ doublets ’ of which Cicero is so
fond5 cf. Lael. 99 allectant et invitant.

58. sibi habeant: sc. iuvenes ,· contemptuous, as in Lael. 18 sibi
habeant sapientiae nomen ; Sull. 26 sibi haberent honores, sibi impen‘a
etc.; cf. the formula of Roman divorce, tu tuas res tibi habeto. --
hastas: in practising, the point was covered by a button, pila ,· cf.
Liv. 26, 51 praepilatis mesu'libus taculati sunt. — clavam: cf. Vege-
tius de Re Mil. 1, 11 clavas lig-*neas pro gladiis teronibus dabant, eoque
modo exercebantur ad palos ,· Iuv. 6, 246. The palus is called saper
by Martial 7, 32. -- pilam...venationes...cursusz all national
amusements‚ well known to readers of Horaee; see Becker's Gallus.

 

Veuationes, em. for nataa‘ones. talos tesseras: tali, ‘knuckle·
bones ', were oblong, and rounded at the two ends; the sides were
numbered ι and 6 (ι being opposite to 6), 3 and 4. Four tali were
used at a time and they, like the tesserae, were generally thrown from
a box, fritillas. The tesserae, of which three were used at a time, were
cubeS, with the sides numbered from ι to 6 in such a way that the
numbers on two opposite sides taken together always made 7. A sep-
arate name was used by dicers for almost every possible throw of the
tesserae and tali. The two best known are canis, when all the dice
turned up with, the same number uppermost; and venus, when they
all showed different numbers. The word alea was general and appli-
cable to games of chance of every kind. These games, which were
forbidden by many ineffectual laws (⁸ vetita legy‘bus alea ’) were held to
be permissible for old men; see Mayor on Iuv. 14, 4. — id ipsum:
sc. faciunt ,· the omission of facere is not uncommon. Roby, 14413
H. 368, 3. n. 1. — ut: em. for ordinary readings unum and utrum.

59. legite ε ‘continue to read ’. Cf. De Or. 1, 34 pergite, utfacitts,
adulescentes. In Tusc. 2, 62 it is stated that Africanus was a great
reader of Xenophon.

P. 25. -- libro· qui est de: so in Fat. 1 libris qui sunt de natura
deorum, and similarly elsewhere; but the periphrasis is often avoided.
as in Off. 2, 16 Dicaearchi liber de interitu hominum. “ qui: quique
might have been expected, but the words above, qui... familiari, are
regarded as parenthetical- -- Oeconomicus ι Cicero translates from
this work e. 4, 20-25. -- inscribitur: see n. on 13. — regale:
‘worthy of a king ’ς different from regium. which would mean ⁸ actu·
ally characteristic of kings ’. Yet Cic. sometimes interchanges the
words3 , thus regalis potestas in Har. Resp. 54 is the same as regia
