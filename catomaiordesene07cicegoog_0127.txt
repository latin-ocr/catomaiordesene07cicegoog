peteretur: em. for peteretur in the MSS. The words expetere, expe
cendum are technically used in Cicero's philosophical works to express
the Greek αἱρεῖσθαι, αἱρετόν as applied to the finis or τέλος, the supreme
aim of moral action. Pulchrum above is a translation of the Greek
καλόν, a term constantly applied to the τέλος, particularly by the Stoics.
spreta et contempta: the first word is much the stronger of
the two3 spernere is καταφρονεῖν, ‘to scorn ’ς contemnere ὀλιγωρεῖσθαι,
‘to make light of ', ‘ hold of no account '. Contemnere is often no
stronger in sense than omittere, ‘ to pass by, neglect ’. Cf. 65 contemni,
despici. —- optimus quisque: see A. 93, c; G. 3053 H. 458, 1.

P. 19. —44. cruditate: ‘indigestion’. —, insomniis: ‘sleep-
lessness ’; the singular insomnium occurs only once in prose (Tac.
Ann. 11, 4). Insomnia‚ ae is found only in poetry and late prose. --
divine τ this word in Cic. often means nothing more than ‘ splendidly ',
‘extraordinarily ’. -— escam malorum z ‘an euticement to evil ’
(esca = ecl-ca, from the root of edo). Plato in the Timaeus 69 D (a dia·
logue translated into Latin by Cicer0, a fragment of whose translation
is still preserved) has ἡδονὴν μέγιστον κ α κ ο ὓ δ ε’ λ ε ap. Cf. also Cic.
Hortensius fr. 76 (ed. Halm) voluptates corporis quae vere et graviter a
Platone dictae sunt illecebrae esse atque escae malorum. modicist
for the sake of variety Cic. chooses this, not modorum, as the opposite
of immoderatir. Trans. ‘a moderate amount of goodfellowship ’. —

 

 

M. F. = Marci filium. —— devicerat: pluperfect where a modern
would incline to use a perfect. The battle referred to is that of Mylae,
fought in 2603 its mernory was perpetuated by the decking of the fo-
rum with the rostra of the captured ships3 the columna rostrata bore
a long inscription, a restored version of which still exists. cena:
so best spelt; some good texts still print caena, but coena is decidedly -
wrong, being based on the fiction that the Latin borrowed the Greek
word κοινή and turned it into coena. cereo funali: ‘the torch-
light ’ς cereo, the em. of Mommsen for crebro ,· the ficnale was a torch
composed of withs or twigs twisted into a rope (ficnis) and dipped in
pitch or oil. -—- sibi . . . sumpserat ε Cic. seems to think that Duil·
lius assumed these honors on his own authority. This was probably
not the case; they were most likely conferred on him by a vote of the
‘camaria m‘buta. Cf. Liv. epit. 17 C. Duillius primus omnium Roma·
norum ducum navalis victoriae duxit triumphum, ob quam causam ei
perpetuus quoque honos habitus est, ut revertenti a cena tibt'cine canente
ficnale praeferretur. No other instance is known where these particu
