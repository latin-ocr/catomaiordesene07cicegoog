Aeneas to the poet's own days. The incident alluded to in Ennius’
verses is evidently the same as that narrated by Livy 32, cc. 9, ια

army opposed to Philip of Macedon, found the king strongly posted
on the mountains between Epirus and Thessaly. For forty days Fla-
mininus lingered, hoping to find some path which would give him ac-
cess to the enemy’s quarters. A shepherd who knew every nook of
the mountains came before the general, and promised to lead the Ro-
man soldiers to the ground above Philip’s camp. This was done, and
