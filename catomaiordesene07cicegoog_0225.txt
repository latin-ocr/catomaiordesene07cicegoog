advocated the same views. -- mortuis iura: the principal ‘rev-
erent rites ’ paid to the dead are mentioned in Cic. Leg. 2, 55 seq.;
cf. especially 57 multa relig-zbsa iura. The passage resembles Tusc.
ι, 26 seq. si...arbitrarentur: cf. Tusc. 1, ²7· For the imper·
fect in arbitrarentur and haereret, modern feeling would require the
pluperfect. Cic. for the moment realizes the past as present, and
so looks on the condition as not wholly past but still continuing.
The usage is like the substitution of the present for the past, for the
sake of vividnesS, in historica] narrativeS. Often both protasis and
apodosis contain a verb in the imperfect where we should expect the
pluperfect (e. g. Verr. 5, 893 Sest. 63); but it does not often happen
that the apodosis has a verb in the pluperfect, while the verb in the
protasis stands in the imperfect, as in C. M. 19 nisi essent...ap-
pel la ssent. Irregularities of the same sort are common in Greek

 

conditional sentences. A. 308, a; G. 599, Rem. ις Η. 510, n. 2. -=-
nihil: adv. acc. with pertinere ,· supply some word referring to iura
above. ad eos pertinere: cf. Aristotle, Eth. Nic. 1, 10, 3 δοκεῖ
γὰρ εἶναί τι τῷ τεθνεῶτι καὶ κακὸν καὶ ἀγαθόν. ——-¹·· fuerunt τ =visce-
runt. See n. on C. M. 21 sunt. The followers of Pythagoras are
meant. -—- nunc quidem: ‘now, 1 admit’; for the concessive use
of quidem cf. 74. tum: some adversative particle (correspond-
ing to sedantem vero or the like) would be inserted in any modern
language. This adversative asyndeton is especially common in Cae·
sar, as in B. G. 1, 18, 1 celeriter consilium dimittit, Liscum retinet ;
cf. 5, 55, 59, 62. ’ “

Ρ. 6. —vel eius: in C. M. 78 Cic. appeals just as he does here
to the Pythagoreans and to Socrates as authorities for the immortal-
ity of the soul. qui: sc. dicebat. -- non: supply quotiens de
hac re diceret. tum hoc tum illud: the later Academics, partic·
ularly Arcesilas and CarneadeS, professing to follow SocrateS, made
a practice of arguing on both sides of every question, and declared
that certainty was unattainable, though probable conclusions might
be formed. They prided themselves on not being obliged to support
dogmatically any set of views; while others were in bondage to doc-
trines, they only were free to put forward ‘now this now that ’. Cf.
Cicero’s Academica passim, but particularly 2, 134 tum hoc mihipra-
babilius, tum illud videtur ,· 2, 121 modo hoc modo illud probabilius
videtur; N. D. 1, 47 Cotta meus modo hoc modo illud. Cf. Intr.
to C. M. p. ii. — ut in plerisque: cf. n. on 50 similium sui; n.
