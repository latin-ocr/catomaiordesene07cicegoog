³8] Nori-:s To CATO MAIOR. 85

mihi . . . est in manibus t ⁴ Ι have on hand ', ⁸ am busy with ⁹. Cf„
n. on 22. — Originum: as to Cato's literary labors see Introd. —
omnia colligo: referring to the materials Cato was collecting for his
‘Origines ’. quascunque defendi: ‘as many as I have con·
ducted '. Defendere causam here is simply to act as counsel in a case,
whether the client be defendant or plaintiff. So in Lael. 96 and often.
-—— nunc cum maxime: ‘ now more than ever ', νῦν μάλιστα.. The
phrase is elliptic; in fun it would be ‘cum maxime conficio orationes,
nunc conficio ⁹, ‘when Ι most of all compose speeches, I now compose
them ’ς i. e. ‘ the time when I most of all compose is now ’. The words
cum maxime generally follow tum or nunc and add emphasis to those
wordS, but are sometimes used alone to express the ideas ‘ then ’ and
‘ now ’ more emphatically than tum and nunc would. Cf. Ver. 4, 823
Tac. Ann. 4, 27. The orators were in the habit of working over their
speeches carefully for publication and preservationi. -— ius augu-
rium etc.: ‘ the law pertaining to the augurs and pontifices ’; i. e. the
principles applied by them in the performance of their duties. The
pontifices had the general oversight of religious observances. See
Dict. of Antiq. — civile ε the meaning of ius cz'vile varies according
to the context. Here it is the secular law as opposed to the sacred
law, as in 503 sometimes it is the whole body of Roman law as op-
posed to the law of other states; often, again, it is the older portion
of the Roman law as opposed to the newer or ‘equity ’ portion. —
commemoro: ‘I say over to myself'. In Cicero commemoro is a
verb of speaking, and never has the meaning of recordor or memini.
curricula: see nn. on 33. ——- magno opere ε better so written
than in one word magnopere ,· so maximo, minimo, nimio opere. —
adsum amicis: ‘I act as counsel to my friends ’. This legal sense
of adesse is common. frequens: literally the word means
⁴ crowded ’ (connected with farcire ‘ to cram ' or ‘to crowd together '),
hence frequens senatus and the like phrases. Then frequens comes
to be used of actions or events that often recur; e. g. Orat. 15 De·-
mosthenesfi‘equens Platonis auditor ,· De Or. 1, 243 frequens te audt'vi.
On the use of the adj. here see A. 1913 G. 324, Rem. 6; H. 443.
— ultro: ‘unasked ’‚ ‘ of my own motion ’‚ a reference to the well·
known story that‚ whatever subject was discussed‚ Cato gave as
his opinion ‘delenda est Carthago '. See Introd. —- tueor: ‘advo-
cate ’‚ ‘support ². lectulus: a conch usually stood in the Ro-
man study, on which the student reclined while reading, composing
