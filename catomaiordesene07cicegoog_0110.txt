74 “ NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. [26

hence cuiusque, sc. senis. So above adulescentia = adulescentes. ’
agens aliquid: this phrase differs from agat in that while the sub-
junctive would express the fact of· action, the participial phrase ex-
presses rather the constant tendency to act. Agens aliquid forms a
sort of attribute to senectus, parallel with operosa. Moliri differs from
agere in that it implies the bringing into existence of some object.
Cf. Off. 3, 102 agere aliquid et moliri volunt‚· Acad. 2, 22 ut
moliatur aliquid etfaciat,· N. D. Ι, 2 utrum di nihil agant, nihil
moliantur ; Mur. 82 et agant et m'oliantur. -— quid . . . aliquid: for
the ellipsis in quid qui cf. n. on 22 quid . . . Addiscunt= τρομανθόνουσι
=learn on and on, go on learning. —ut...videmus: put, as
Allen observeS, {or ut Solon ficit, quem videmus. Solonem τ’ see
also 50. The line (versibus here is an exaggeration; in 50 it is versi-
culus) is preserved by Plato in his Timaeus and by Plutarch, Sol. 31
γηράσκω δ’ ἀεὶ πολλὰ διδασκόμενος. The age of Solon at his death is

 

 

variously given as 80 or 100 years. —— videmus: the Latins fre-
quently use ‘we see ' for ‘we read ’. See n. on Lael. 39, also below,
69 ut scriptum video. gloriantem: Α.-292, e; G. 536, 527, Rem. 1 ;
H. 535, Ι, 4. Notice the change to the infinitive in uti below. —
senex: i. e. cum senex essem; so 27 adulescens desiderabam ; 30 =me·
mini puer. Plutarch (Cato 2) gives an account of Cato's study of
Greek in his old age. ——- sic ε this word does not qualify avide, but
refers on to quasi, so that sic.. . quasi cupiens: ‘thus, viar. like one
desiring ’. Cf. n. on 12 ita cupide fruebar quasi ,· also 35 tamquam . . .
sic. Quasi serves to soften the metaphor in suim; cf. n. on Lael. 3.
cupiens: after quasi a finite verb (cuperem) would have been
more usual, as in 12 ita...qicasi dibinarem. Cf. however 22 quasi
desipientem. — ea ipsa mihi: for the juxtaposition of pronounS,
which is rather sought after in latin, cf. 72 ipsa suum eadem quae.
-- exemplis : = pro exemplis, or exemplorum loco (cf. n. on 21 Lysi·
maehum), so that those editors are wrong who say that we have here
an example of the antecedent thrust into the relative clause, as though
ea ipsa quibus exemplis were put for ea ipsa exempla quibus. quod:
= utcum iam senex esset disceret. Socraten: Cic. probably learned
this fact from Plato's Menexenus 23 5 E ¹and Euthydemus 272 c where
Connus is named as the teacher of Socrates in music. In the Euthy-
demus Socrates says that the boys attending Connus’ lessons laughed
at him and called Connus γεροντοδιδάσκαλον. Cf. also Fam. 9, 22, 3
Socraten fidibus docuit nobem-simus fidicen ‚⁸ is Connus vocitatus est ‚· Val.
