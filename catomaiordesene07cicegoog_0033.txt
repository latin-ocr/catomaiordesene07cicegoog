INTRODUCTION.

(c). Argument from fact: instances of old men in
public and in private lise who till death were
actively at work ..........

Β. Rebuttal of the second charge, that old age weak·
ens the physical powers.

(a). Old age does not desire nor require the strength
of youth, because it may exert influence
through other means. lnstances cited to show
this ...............

(b). Temperate habits will retain a good measure
of strength till old age (33, 34) ; many instances
of weakness in old age may be attributed to
ill-health‚ which is common to all periods of
life (3 5); proper care will greatly retard de-
cay ...............

c. Refutation of the third charge, that old age takes
away the capacity sor enjoyment.

(a). The pleasures in which youth finds its keenest
enjoyment are in themselves bad, and old age
is beneficent in freeing from their allurements

x (b). Old age has pleasures far more refined and sat·
isfying than those of sense .......
Such as, those of conversation and literature
(4 5- 50) 3 especially those of agriculture( 5 1-61) ;
and lastly‚ the exercise of influence‚ which old
age will always possess if a rightly spent youth
has preceded (62-64).

(c). The special objection that old men’s tempers
spoil their enjoyments is met by the statement
that this is the fault of character, not of age .

D. Refumtion of the fourth charge, that old age is
unhappy because it involves the anticipation of
death.

(a). Since the right aim of life is to live not long
but well, death ought not to be dreaded at any

age ...............
