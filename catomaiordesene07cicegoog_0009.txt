1. CICERO AS A WRITER ΟΝ PHILOSOPHY.

(ἰ.) Sura or Pnuosopnv m C1cnno’s Tmr..

ΙΝ Philosophy the Romans originated nothing. Their ener-
gies in the earlier years of the state were wholly absorbed in
organization and conquest. Resting in a stern and simple
creed, they had little speculative interest in matters outside
the hard routine of their daily life. But with the close of the
Period os Conquest came a change. The influx of wealth from
conquered provinces, the formation of large landed estates, the
excessive employment of slave labor, and the consequent rise
of a new aristocracy‚ prepared the way for a great revolution.
The old religion lost its hold on the higher classes3 something
was needed to take its place. With wealth and luxury came
opportunity and desire for culture. Greece, with Art, Liter-
.ature, and Philosophy sully developed and highly perfected‚
stood ready to instruct her rude conqueror.¹

In Cicero's time the productive era of Greek Philosophy had
well-nigh passed. Its tendency was less speculative, more ethi-
cal and practical than in the earlier time. There were four
prominent schoOIS, the N ew Academy‚ the PeripatetiC, the Stoic,
and the Epicurean. The supporters of the last-named advo· „
cated in Science the doctrine of the atom‚ in Ethics the pursuit
of pleasure, in Religion the complete inactivity of the gods.

¹ Horace, Ep. 2, 1, 156:—

Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit, et aroes
Intulit agresti Latio.
