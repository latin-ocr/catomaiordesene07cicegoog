76 NOTES To CATO MAROR. [27

verb statement. Roby, ¹544-15463 Madvig, 370, 494, Obs. 5, (6). —
vox: ‘ utterance '3 the word is used only of speeches in some 'way
speeially remarkable. — contemptior: ‘more despicable ’. The
passive participle of contemno has the sense of an adjective in Matr,
like invidus and many others. — Milonis: the most famous of the
Greek athletes. He lived at the end of the sixth century Β. e„ and
the praises of his victories were sung by Simonides. It was under
his leadership that his native city Croton, in Magna Graecia, attacked
and destroyed Sybaris. Many stories are told by the ancients about
his {eats of strength (see 33), and about his power of consuming food.
He is said to have been a prominent disciple of Pythagoras. —‚-— ina-
crirnans: beware of spelling lacrima with either ch for c or y for i;
these spellings are without justification. The y rests on the absurd
assumption that the Latins borrowed their word lacrima straight from
the Greek δάκρυ. dixisse: combinations like dieitur dixisse are

 

exceedingly rare in good Latin. Cicero nearly always uses two differ—
ent verbs; i. e. he says aiunt dicere and the like. — at: there is an
ellipsis here such as ‘ those young men’s muscles are powerful but . . . ’.
This elliptic use of at is common in sudden exclamations of grief,
annoyance, surprise etc. vero: this is common in emphatic re-
plieS, whether the reply convey assent, or, as here, a retort. The

 

usage is well illustrated in Niigelsbach's stilistik, ξ 197, 2. — tam:
sc. mortui sunt. — nugator: nugari= ληρεῖν, ‘to trifle ⁹. — cx te ε

Cato here identifies a man’s person with his soul and intellect‚ the
body being regarded as a mere dress: cf. Rep. 6, 26 mens cuiusque is
est quisque. Ex te, literally, ‘ out of yourselt ’, i. e. ‘from your real
self’s resources ’. lateribus: see n. on 14. —— Aelius: his cogb
nomen was Paetus; he was consul in 198, and censor in 194 Β. c. He
was one of the earliest and most famous writers on Roman Law.
His great commentary on the xn tables is often referred to by Cicer0‚
who several times quotes Ennius' line about him—egregie cordatus
homo catus Aelius Sextus. —— tale : sc. dzlxit. —- Coruncanius: n.
on 1 5. P. Crassus: consul in 205 B. c. with the elder Africanus:
pontifex maximus from 212 to ‚his death in 183. He was famous both
as a lawyer (see belovv, 503 also Liv. 30, 1, 5 iuris pontifici pentat-si·
mur) and as a statesman (see 61). Modo therefore covers a space of
at least 33 γῦπε, so that it cannot well be translated by our ‘ lately ’ς
say rather ‘nearer our time ’. The amount of time implied by modo
ancl nuper depends entirely on the context ; for modo see Lael. 6 with
