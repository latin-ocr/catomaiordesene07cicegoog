74 N OTES To LAELIUS. [28

Pyrrhus and Hannibal. The traditional Roman view of Hannibal
is expressed by Horace’s abominatus Hannibal (Epod. 16, 8 y, yet the
charges brought against him can be thoroughly disproved even from
the information preserved by Roman historians. See e. g. Liv. 21,
215 25, 173 27, 28. Cf. n. on C. M. 75 hostie. On Pyrrhus consult

vel in...vel in. — quid: see references on C. M. 1 quid. — est
si moveantur: a common form of the conditional sentence in
Cicer03 cf. Academ. 1, 7 siveZenonem sequa re magnum est. The sense

cunt referring to the repetition of an ¹action (⁸ as often as ’ ‘whenever ’,
‘every time that ') though generally accompanied by the indicative,
is sometimeS, as here, used with the subjunctive. The subjunctive
gives¹ a more hypothetical coloring to the verb statement and has
about the force of a general condition. See Madvig, 3 593 cf. A. 3225
G. 585, Rem.; H. 507, 3. — coniuncti: here no participle bat a
mere adjective3 so many other past participles in Cic. lose their par-
ticipial force, particularly commendatus. — studio: sc. amici. —
consuetudine: ‘familiarity’. '

P. 18. — motum animi: :applicationem animi in 27} a narrower
sense than that in 48. — et amoris: for antor is peinceps ad benevo-

the metaphor is modified by ut ita dez-am, for which see n. on 49.

— minimum se: af. 26, 453 De Or. 1, 123 ut in quoque oratore
