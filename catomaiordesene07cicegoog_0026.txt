xviii INTRODUCTION.

In looking after the property and income ot the state Cato
followed the same principles he had acted on in Spain. He
reduced the expenditur-e on public works as iar as possible, and
took care to sell at the full price the right to collect the revenue.
Encroachments on the property of the nation were severely
punished.

Not by acts only, but by constant speeches, full at once oi
grimness and humor, did Cato struggle against the degeneracy
of his time.¹ He concluded his period of office with a sels-lau-
datory hai-angue, and assumed the title Censorius, while his statue
was placed in the temple of the goddess Salus with an inscription
affirming that he had reformed the Roman nation.

But in a very brief time all trace of Cato’s activity as censor
was swept away, except that afforded by the numerous life-long
quarrels in which he had involved himself.2 In less than two
years one of his victimS, Purpurio, was employed by the senate
on a high political mission, while another, L. Flamininus, sat
among the senators at the games in defiance of Cato's sentence.
Yet Cato remained by far the most powerful member of the

 

senate. Titus Flamininus, his only important rival, quickly '

passed out of notice. So far as there was any democratic
opposition to the senatorial oligarchy, Cato was the leader of
that opposition for the remainder of his life. But at that period
no great political movements agitated the state within3 nearly
the whole interest of the time was centred in the foreign relations
of Rome. On matters of foreign policy Cato offered but little
opposition to the prevailing tendencies of the age, though on‘
particular occasions h‘e exercised great influence. But his voice
was at all times loudly heard on all questions of morality and
public order. He supported the lex Furia and the lex Voconia,
the object of which was to prevent the dissipation of family prop·
erty, and the lex Orchia, directed against extravagant expendi·
