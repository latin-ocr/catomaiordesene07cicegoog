γένος, οὗ μεῖζον ἀγαθὸν οὔτ’ ἦλθεν οὔθ’ ἥξει ποτὲ τᾷ θνητῷ γένει δωρηθὲν
ἐκ θεῶν, which Cic. thus turns in his translation, at the end of the
fragment of it which is preserved: quo bono nullum optabilius nullum
praestantius neque datum est mortalium gtneri deorum concessu atque
munere neque dabitur. Cic. frequently imitates the passage, as below,
473 Academica 1, 73 Tusc. 1, 643 Leg. 1, 58. — divitias alii etc.:
cf. closely 86. — extremum: extremum here =finis, in the sense of
finis bonorum or summum bornum. The passage is aimed a Epicurus
and his followers who pecudis et hominis idem bonum censen (Academ.
1, 6).

P· 9. - caduca et incerta: ‘fleeting and unstable ’ς cf. De Dom.
146 caduca semper et mobilia. -— illi: sc. faciunt. Illi, the Stoics and
Peripatetics. -—- nec sine etc.: cf. 18 miri in bouelt amicitiam esse non
posse. This matter is touched on by Aristotle, Eth. Nic. 8, 1, 73 ib.
8, 2, 3 seq. —- esse: emphatic; ‘ exist ’.

21. iarn ε = ‘to proceed ’‚ as often. — consuetudine sermonis:
d. Verr. 4, ¹09 cotidiana dez-endi consuetudine. -— nec . . . metiamur:
not intended to contrast strongly with the first part οἱ the sentence,
otherwise non would have been written for nec and eam omitted.
The clause is really explanatory τε non metientes. For the construc-
tion οἱ metiri d. n. on 97, and for the expression μετρεῖν τι τινι in
Aristotle’s Ethics. magnificentia: cf. Plato Symp. 210 D καλοὺς

 

λόγους καὶ μεγαλοπρεπεῖς. So magnificum in 32. —virosquet ‘⁴ If ,

a negative proposition is followed by an affirmative, in which the
same thought is expressed or continued, que, et or ac is employed
in· Latin where in English we use ‘but’ ”. Madvig, 433, Obs. 23
d. Roby, 2200. —- Paulos etc.: the plural in the sense of ‘men
like P.’ etc. For Paulus, ct'. 93 for Gallus 9 and ¹03 for Philus 14.
—— omnino.. . reperiuntur: cf. 9, 18, n. on nemo.

22. opportunitates: the word opportunitas is ‘ opportuneness ’.
rather than ‘ opportunity '. To say that friendship has ‘opportune-
nesses ’ is equivalent to saying that it shows the characteristic of
‘opportuneness’ on many occasions, Cicero uses the plural of ab·
straet nouns like this more frequently than any other author. cf.
A. 75, c; G. 195, Rem. 53 H. 130, 2. vix queo: Cic. always
says non queo or vix quea, never nequeo, though he uses other parts
