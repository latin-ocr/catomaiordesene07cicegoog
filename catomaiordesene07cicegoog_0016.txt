striking portions of the Phaedo, 72 ¹³-73 B, 78-80.ι The view
of the divine origin and destiny of the human soul contained in
the passage from the Phaedo is rendered by Cicero in many of
his works‚² and was held by him with quite a religious fervor
and sincerity.

Besides these instances of special indebtedness Cicero, in
composing the Cato Maior, was no doubt under obligations of
a more general kind to the Greeks. The form of the dialogue
is Greek, and Aristotelian rather than Platonic. ⁸ But further,
it is highly probable that Cicero owed to some particular Greek
dialogue on Old Age the general outline of the arguments he
there brings forward. Many of the Greek illustrative allusions
may have had the same origin, though in many cases Roman
illustrations must have been substituted for Greek. Whether
the dialogue by Aristo Cius, cursorily mentioned in the Cato
Maior,⁴ was at all used by Cicero or not it is impossible to de·

The Cato Maior is a popular essay in Ethics, applying the
principles of philosophy to the alleviation of one of life’s chief
burdens, old age. In ancient times, when philosophy formed the
real and only religion of the educated class, themes like this were
deemed to afford a worthy employment for the pens even of the
greatest philosophers. Such essays formed the only substitute
the ancients had for our Sermons. There can be no doubt of
Cicero’s sincerity when he says that the arguments he sets
