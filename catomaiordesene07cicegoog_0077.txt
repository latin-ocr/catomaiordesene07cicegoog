2] NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. 41

of this and similar contractione may be found in Frohwein, Die Per·
fectbildungen auf -vi bei Cicer03 Gera, 1874. — humanitatem:
⁶ culture ’3 i. e. learning resulting in gentleness and refinement of
character. prudentiam: φρόνησιν οι· practical wisdom. Corn.
Nepos (or his imitator) in his life of Atticus 17, 3 says of him prin-
cipum philosophorum ita percepta habuit praecepta ut ln‘s ad vitam agen-
dam non ad ostentationem uteretur. —isdem rebus: i. e. the state
of public affairs at the time3 see Introd. -- quibus me ipsum:
strictly speaking the construction is inaccurate, since suspicor com-
moveri must be supplied, and Cicero does not really mean to say that
he merely conjecncres himself to be seriously affected by the state of
public affairs; ego epse commoveor would have accurately expressed
his meaning. The accusative is due to the attraction of te above.
— maior = difficilior aa often3 e. g. Lael. ²9 quod maius est.
visum est mibi conscribere := placuit milti, ‘ 1 have determined
to write ⁹. The best writers rarely use the impersonal videbar etc.
followed by an infinitive. When the usage occurs videtin milti etc.
generally have the meaning (as here) of δοκεῖ μοι κ. τ. λ.--“Ι have

 

 

made up my mind ’. Cf. Tusc. 5, 12 Non mihi videtur ad beate
vivendum satis posse virtutem ‚· ib. 5, 22 (a curious passage) mihi
enim non videbatur quisquam esse beatus posse cum esset in malis ,· in
malis autem sapientem esse posse; Off. 3, 71 malitia quae volt
illa quidem videri se esse prudentiam (‘ craft which desires that people
should believe it to be wisdom ⁹) ς Liv. 1, 10, 7 dis visum nec it-ritam
conditoris templi vocem esse . . . (‘ the gods decided that the word of the
founder of the shrine should not remain of no effect '). It would be
difficolt, if not impossible, to find a passage in a writer before silver
Latin times where the best texts still exhibit anything like valletur eum
fiecere for is videtur facere. H. 534, 1, n. 13 Roby, 1353. aliquid
ad te: ‘some work dedicated to you'3 so below, 33 cf. also Lael. 4
ut de amicitia scriberem aliquid ,· ib. Catone maiore qui est scriptus ad te
de senectute ,· Div. 2, 3 liber is quem ad nostrum Atticum de senectute
misimus.

2. aut . . .aut certe: so often in Cic.; certe, ‘at any rate ’.—-
senectutis: at the time the words were written Cic. was 62 years old,
Atticus three years older. For the meaning of senectus see n. on 4.
levari volo: the best Latin writers frequently use the passive
infinitive after verbs expressing desire, where moderns would incline
to the active; here Cic. instead of saying ‘I wish to relieve yourseli
