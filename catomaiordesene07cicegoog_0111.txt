27] NOTES To CATO MAIOR. 75

Max. 8, 7, 8. —— in fidibus: ‘in the case oi the lyre’. Tiicking
quotes Quintilian 9, 2, 5 quod in fidibus-finivimus: The Greek
word cithara is not used by Cicero and does not become common in
Latin prose till long after Cicero’s time, though he several times uses
the words citharoedus, ct'thamirta, when referring to Greek professional
players. The word lyra too is rare in early prose; it occurs in Tusc.
1, 4 in connection with a Greek, where in the same sentence fides is
used as anequivalent. — audii-emt for audire = legendo cmo-rcere
see n. on 2o. — vellem: sc. si possem. — discebant . . . antiqui:
doubts have been felt as to the genuineness of the clause. In Tusc.
4, 3 a passage of Cato is quoted which refers to the use of the tibia
among the ancient Romans; immediately afterwards the antiquity of
practice on the fides at Rome is mentioned, though not expressly on
Cato’s authority. The words cannot be said to be unsuited either to
the person or to the occasion. —— discebant . .. fidibus: the verb
canere, which means ‘ to play ' as well as ‘ to sing '‚ must be supplied3
fidibus is then an ablative of the means or instrument. There is the
same ellipsis of canere in the phrases docere fidibus (Fam. 9, 22, 3) and
scire fidibus (Terence, Eunuchus 133). Cf. Roby‚ 1217.

P. 12. — 2⁷. ne . . . quidem: these two words together correspond
to the Greek οὐδέ (οὔ =ne, δέ = quidem), ancl are best translated here
by ‘ nor ' rather than by ‘ not even ’. The rendering ‘ not even ', though
required by some passages, will often misrepresent the Latin. —
locus: locus (like τόπος in Greek) is a rhetorical term with a technical
.meaning. The pleader is to anticipate the arguments he may find it
’necessary to use in different caseS‚ and is to arrange them under cer·
tain heads; each head is called a τόπος or locus, meaning literally the
place where a pleader is to look for an argument when wanted. Hence
locus came to mean ‘a cut-and-dried argument’ or, as here, a ‘com-
monplace ’. It is often found in Cicero’s rhetorical writings. —
non plus quam: ‘ any more than '. After the negative ne above it is
incorrect to translate non by a negative in English, though the repe·
tition of the negative is common enough in Latin, as in some English
dialects. Cf. n. on 24. Plus here = mugit. quod est: sc. tibi,
‘ what you have ', so Paradoxa 18 and 52 satis· esse, quod est. agas:
quisquis is generally accompanied by the indicative, as in Verg. Aen. 2,
49 quidquid id est etc.; see Roby‚ 1697; A. 309, c; G. 246, 43 H. 476,
3. The subjunctive is here used, with the imaginary second person,
to render prominent the hypothetica] and indefinite character of the
