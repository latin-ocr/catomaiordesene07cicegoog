56 NOTES TO LAELIUS. [12

i. e. death so sudden as his; for the form of expression cf. n. on 4. —
vere: there is a loose contrast with dzfficile dictu est, which implies
nihil veri potest dici. -— celeberrimos: not ‘most famous ’ but
(literally) ⁸ most attended by crowds ’, i. e. days on which Scipio was
the centre of the popular interest. Cf. Reid's n. on Arch. 4 —
clarissimum: for the application of clarus to things as well as
persons, Nagelsbach quotes Div. 2, 853 Att. 6, 1, 22 clan'ssimi iuris
iurandi. N otice the emphasis given by the repetition of diem from
diebus. — reductus est: it was the custom in times of excitement
for leading statesmen to be escorted to the senate-house from their
homes and back again by their admirers. For the escort away from
home deducere is generally used, for the escort homewards reducere.
See C. M. 63, where the two words occur together, as they do in
Val. Max. 2, 1, 9. For the mood see A. 336, b; G. 630, Rem. 13 H.
5²4· 2, 2). ad vesperum: with the prepositions ad, sub, in, the
accusative of vesper is generally used and not that of vespera. >
populo Romano: simply = civibus, the burgesseS, as opposed to
'the socii and Latini. — sociis et Latinis: these two words must
be taken together as forming one member of the enumeration, par-
allel with patribus conscriptis and populo Romano. When an enumer-
ation consists of only two members Cicer0, except in certain special
cases, never omits the copula3 when there are three or more mem-
berS, he either puts et before each member after the first or leaves it
out altogether. In our passage, if sociis and Latinis had each of
them been entitled to rank separately in the enumeration, it would
have been necessary to strike out ct. Madvig has most thoroughly
discussed this matter in a note on Fin. 4, 56 and in Opuscula 1,
p. 333 seq. The practice of most other writers of the best period
agrees on the whole with that of Cicero in this respect. Cf. n. on
84. ——— superos . . . deos .. . inferos: the word deos is purposely not
placed immediately after superos, in order to prevent the reader from
understanding inferos to mean inferos deos. With this arrangement
superos . .. deos means, as Seyffert explains it, superi, qui dei mnt.

13. nuper: not quite accurate (cf. 24, n. on C. M. 61, also on modo
in 6) inasmuch as the knowledge of the Greek speculations which
denied the soul’s existence after death had begun to spread among the
educated classes at Rome long before ncipio’s death. The reference
is chiefly, but not solely, to the Epicureans. Some of the Peripatetics
and some also of the new Academics held or at least sometimes
