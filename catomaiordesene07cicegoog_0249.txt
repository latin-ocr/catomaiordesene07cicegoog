39] N OTES TO LAELIUS. 81

quidem: here concessive, not affirmative; ‘ though especially’. —
qui... accedunt: these are the persons mentioned in 19 as viros
bonos etc.

39. videmus: here, as in 56 and often,= scriptum videmus. Cf.
Academ. 2, 129 nobilis discepIIna, cuius, ut scri ptum vedeo, prin·
ceps Xenophanes. See n. on C. M. 26 videmus. -— Aemilium
Luscino: Q. Aemilius Papus and C. Fabric'ms Luscinus (see n. on
18) were colleagues in the consulship in 282 and 278 and in the cen·
sorshipjn 275 13. c. Familtaris‚ like amicus, takes a dative when it is
treated as an adjective, and a genitive when it is a substantive. For
Papum Aemilium, the cognomen put before the nomen (a practice ex·
tremely common in Tacitus and his contemporaries), cf. Q. Fr. 2, 4, 1
Macer Licinius. sic: the clauses bis . .. censura are explanatory
of sic. patribus : -—-· maioribus, though in 6 (apud patres nostros)
patres has the strict sense. Note the omission of [νὼ-ει. tum:
this probably has not a tempora] meaning here, but = deinde ‘ next in
order ’‚ as though primum had preceded. -— Curium...Corunca-
nium: nn. on 18. memoriae: see n. on C. M. 63. —— igitur:
here (like our phrase ‘well then’) serves to introduce a new step in Α
the statement. The position of {gitur as first word in the sentence,
though regular in Sallust and very common in succeeding writers, is
in Cicero exceptional and emphatic. A. 156, e and k; G. 503 and
Rem.; H. 554, IV. 3. — ne suspicari quidem: this implies the
contrast ‘ much less can we believe '. — contendisse: for the con
struction contendere aliquid ab aliquo ‘to press some one for some-
thing ’ cf. Plane. ·12 meum beneficium ad eum potius detuli qui a me
contenderat ; Verr. 2, 131 hic magistratus a populo summa ambitione
contenditur. A clause with ut often takes the place of the accusative.
· —- fidem: ‘a promise ⁹, or ‘a pledge ’. — hoc quidem: ‘a re-
quest of this kind '‚ dependent on impetraturum, not on dicere.
contendisset: sc. aliquis ex eis,· for the omission of the subject to
the verb cf. n. on 59 esset osurus. sanctissimi viri: ‘the purest
of men ⁹. — rogatum: not in agreement with aliquzd, but with the
unexpressed subject (aliquem = τινά) of the infinitive fizcere ,· cf. ro·
gati below. — at vero: ‘but truly'. Laelius intends this sentence
to carry with it the inference that the friendship between Gracchus
on the one hand. and Carbo, Cato etc. on the other, was no true
friendship. —— Carbo: cf. 41, 96. C. Papirius Carbo became. after

the death of Ti. GracchuS, one ot the commissioners for carrying out
