his thirtieth year. The lot assigned him as quaestor to Scipio,
then in Sicily and about to cross over into Africa. The chance
was most unfortunate, if for no other reason, because Cato was
intimately connected with the party in the senate opposed to
Scipio, which had been attempting to bring him to trial for the ’
atrocities committed by the Roman army in southern Italy.
But in addition the two men were so utterly different that there
was no possibility of the quaestor standing in that filial relation
to his consul, which old Roman custom required. As financial
officer, Cato complained of the luxury and extravagance which
Scipio allowed not only to himself but to his army. Yet the
complaint was made not so much on economic as on moral
grounds; it seemed to Cato that the old Roman discipline and
power to endure hardships were being swept away. The dis-
pute was ended by Scipio allowing Cato to return to Rome,
some authorities say from Sicily, others from Africa. Accord-
ing to one writer,¹ he came home by way of Sardinia and brought
thence with him Ennius the poet.2

In 199 Cato was plebeian aedile. and exercised with severity
the police jurisdiction pertaining to that office, yet so as to win
popular approval, since he was chosen praetor for 198 without
the usual interval. The province of Sardinia was entrusted to
him, and he strained every nerve to make his government pre-
sent as strong a contrast as possible with the lax and corrupt
administration of the nobles who took Scipio for their pattern.

kind severely dealt with 3 in money matters the strictest economy

passed from town to town attended by a single servant.
