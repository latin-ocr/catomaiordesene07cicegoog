16] NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. 63

Cicero generally separates from the words they qualify quan, tan, ita,
tantus, quantus, often, as here, by one small word. cf. below, 35
quamsuit imbecillus ,· 40 tan esse inimimm. — quibus: the prepo-
sition a is often omitted3 cf. in Pis. 91 Arsinoen . ..Naupactum salmis
ab hostibus esse captas. Quibus hostibus? Nempe eis, etc.3 Tusc- 3,
37 sed traducis cogitatzbnes meas ad voluptates. Quas? Even when
relative and antecedent are in the same sentence the preposition is
not often repeated3 e. g. Fin. 5, 68 eodem in genere quo illa. — an
eis: an always introduces a question which is not independent, but
follows upon a previous question either expressed or implied. Here
quibus implies omnibusne. cf. div. in Caec. 52 quidenim dices? An
id quodem-titas . . . where quid implies nihihte ‚· also below, 23, 29 antee.
A. 211, b; G. 4593 1-1. 353, 2, n. 4.——iuventute et viribus:
commonly explained as a hendiadys, i. e. as put for iuventutis· viribus:
but Cic. no more meant this than we mean ‘the strength of youth ’
when we speak of ‘youth and strength ’. Real instances of hendiadys
are much rarer than is generally supposed. —— quae z acates ut. ——
L. Paulus: this is L. Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus, consul in 182
Β. c., and again in 168 when he finished the third Macedonian war by
utterly defeating Perseus at Pydna. For his connection with Scipio ·
and Cato see Introd- — pater tuus: i, e. Scipio ,⁰ so in 29 avi tui,
and in 75 avum mum, without mention of young Scipio's name, but
in 49 patris tui, Scipio ‚· so 77. - Fabricii etc.= for the plurals see
n. on 13. C. Fabricius Luscinus, consul in 282, 278, and 273 Β. e.,
censor in 27 5, held the command against Pyrrhus. The Roman writ- Ι
ers, Cicero especially, are never tired of eulogizing him as a pattern

of old-fashioned Roman virtue. Manius Curius Dentatus, consul in
290, 27 5, and 274 practically, if not formally, ended the third Samnite
war, and also commanded against Pyrrhus; see 55. He was iamed
for his sturdy Roman simplicity and frugality. Tiberius Coruncanius
as consul in 280 crushed an Etruscan insurrection. In 252 he became

· the first plebeian pontifex maximus. These three men are very fre-

quently mentioned together by Cicer03 cf. below, 43, Lael. 18. —-
nihil agebant: observe that nihil agebat is put at the beginning oi the
first sentence, nihil agebant at the end of the second3 chiasmus.

16. A. Claudi: Appius Claudius, the head of the most strongly
aristocratic family in Rome, was censor in 311 1³.c., when he con-.
structed the via Appia, and consul in 307 and 296. He had to be
carried into the senate-house in order to oppose the peace with Pyr·
