cusses the question how great a difference in character or other cir·
cumstances is required to render friendsbips impossible. Cf. Eth.
Nic. 8, 7, 4.

⁷5. quaedam: n. on 6 alio quodam. — nec enim: followed by
et saepe instead of nec ,· for the slight anacoluthon cf. 79, 104. —-·
fabulas: n. on 70; cf. Off. 3, 94 ut redeamus ad fabulas. -— Ne-
optolemus: or Pyrrhus, son of Achilles by Deidamia, daughter of
Lycomedes, king of Scyros. He appears in the Philoctetes as an
ambassador to that hero, without whose bow it was fated Troy should
not fall. Welcker thinks that Cicero here refers to a scene in a lost

play οἱ Sophocles entitled αἱ Σκύριαι.
C. M. 11 dividenti.

P. 29. —- mollisque: the que merely connects infirmus with mollis
and does not correspond with the first et. In Cicero and the best
writers et and que do not correspond. Trans. ‘is not only weak and
effeminate, but also...’. —- parum iustus: ‘far from reasonable’g

76. atque ...impetrarit this is a little summary of 73-75. Such
summaries ase often introduced by atque=‘now’, as in Acad. 1, 42.
in omni re: ‘on every occasion '. — iam enim etc.: the verae
amicitiae or perfectae are sempiternae ,⁶ see 32 and Aristot. Eth. Nic. 8,

cussed in 3² seq. and is considered by Aristotle in Eth. Nic. 9, 3. -—
sapientium: = virorum bonor-mn as defined in 21. volgaris
amicitias: these differ only m degree from the verae amn-ittae, being
based on a less degree of vi,rtus since virtus a caritate volgi non abhor-
ret (50), hence they must not be confounded with the φιλίαι based on
τὸ ἡδύ and τὸ ὠφέλιμον which Aristotle so often discusses. These
latter friendships Cicero refuses to deal with; see 58 etc. oratio
delabitur: so 100 oratt'o dssuxit‚· cf. Qu. Fr. 1, 1, 18 ad praecipiendi
rationem delapsa est oratio mea. For the sense also 100 is to be com·
