had been set by P. Scipio Africanus. Most provincial governors
drove their subjects into war, sent lying despatches home about
their victorieS, and claimed a triumph. In 190 Cato attacked
with success the proposal to grant a triumph to Q. Minucius
Thermus, who had already triumphed over the Spaniards as
praetor, and aster his consulship in 193 had fought against the Ligu-
riaus, Cato’s next victim was his former commander M’. Acilius
Glabrio, who came forward at the same time with Cat0, Marcel-
lus (a son of the captor of Syracuse), L. Cornelius Scipio Nasica,
T. Quinctius Flamininus (the conqueror of Macedonia) and
Cato’s friend L. Valerius Flaccus, as candidate for the censor-

from his candidature. On this occasion Cato and Flaccus failed,
Marcellus being elected as plebeian and Flamininus as patrician

In the next year (188) Cato acted in the senate with the party
which tried unsuccessfully to refuse the triumph to the two con-

former of whom had gained none but trifling advantages over
the Aetoliam, while the latter had disgraced the Roman name
by making war without authorization upon the Gauls of Asia
Minor, and had also suffered a humiliating defeat from some ‚
Thracian robber bands on his homeward march. Not disheart-
ened by ill success, Cato and his friends determined to strike at

higher game. L. Scipio Asiaticus (or Asiagenus)‚ the brother
of AfricanuS, was asserted in the senate to have appropriated
3000 talents of public money when in command against Antio-
chus. Legal proceedings were taken not only against AsiaticuS,
but against AfricanuS, who behaved with great violence and
arrogance. In the end Africanus withdrew to his country estate,
while his brother was condemned to paya heavy fine. Adeath·
stroke had been given to the almost kingly authority of Africa·
nus, who never again showed his face in Rome. The proceed-
