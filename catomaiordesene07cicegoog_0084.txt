actors are human beings. — sed tamen etc: ‘but for all that it
was inevitable that there should be something with the nature of an
end. ’ So 69 in quo est aliquid extremum‚· 43 aliquid pulchrum. —
arborum bacis. the word baca (the spelling bacca has little or no
authority) is applied to all fruits growing on bushes or trees3 cf. Tusc.
1, 31 arbores seret diligens agricola, quarum aspiciet bacam ipse num-
quam. -—— terraeque fructibus: here = cereals, rootS, vegetableS,
and small fruits. No sharp distinction can be drawn between fruges
and fluctus (e. g. in Div. 1, 116 we have fruges terrae bacasve arborum),
though fructus as commonly used is the more general word of the two.
—maturitate . . ‚caducumt ‘a time of senility‚ so to speak‚ and
readiness to drop, that comes of a seasonable ripeness ’. Victus is
literally ‘twisted ’ or ⁸ bent ', being originally the passive participle of
viere. The comparison of old age with the ripeness of fruit recurs in
71. Cf. Pliu. Ep. 5, 14, 5 non tam aetatis maturitate quam vitae. —
ferundum ε the form in -undus is archaic‚ and generally used by Cic.
in quoting or imitating passages of laxis, sacred formulae, and the like.
ΙΙ. 239. — molliter: here ‘gently’, ‘ with resignation ’; though mol-
liter ferre often has another meaning, viz. to bear pain or trouble in
an unmanly fashion. Cf. facillime ferre below.— quid est aliud
etc.= The words perhaps imply the rationalistic explanation of myths

which the Greeks had begun to teach to the Romans during Cato²s
lifetime. Trans. ‘what else but resistance to nature is equivalent to

warring against the gods ⁹, and not ‘what else does warring with the
gods mean but to resist nature ’. In comparisons of this sort the
Latins generally put the things compared in a different order from
that required by English idiom. Thus in Div. 2, 78 quid est aliud
nolle moneri a Iove nisi efficere ut aut ne fieri possit auspicium aut, si
fiat, videri, · S. Rosc. 54 quid est aliud iudicio ac legibus ac maiestate
vestra abuti ad quaestum ac lifflh1d1nem,nisae hoc modo accusare,· Phil. 1,
223 2, 7; 5, 5; 10, 5. ——Gigahtum modo: see n. on 4 Aetna gra·
vius. — dis: for the form dis see n. on 2 5

6. atqui. in the best Latin atqui does not introduce a statement
contradicting the preceding statement, but one that supplements it.
Here it may be translated ‘True, but’. Cf. 66, 81.-— gratissi-
mum: equivalent to rem gratissimam. With the thought cf. Rep. 1,
34 gratum jeceris si explet-aris ,· Lael. 16 pergratum seceris si dispu
turis. ut. . .pollicear: so Acad. 1, 33 nos vero volumus, ut pro
Attico respondeam ; Brut. 122 nobis vero placet, ut pro Bruto etiam re
