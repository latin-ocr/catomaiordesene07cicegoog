28] NOTES To CATO MAIOR. 77

note, for nuper below, n. on 61, where it is used of Crassus as modo
is here. — praescribebantur: the meaning is that these lawyers
practised in old age as jurisconsults; i. e. according to old Roman
custom, they gave audience in the early hours of the day to all who
chose to consult them about legal difficulties. -- est provecta:
literally ‘was carried forward', i. e. ‘continued ⁸, ‘remained ⁸. Some
wrongly take the phrase to mean ‘ made progress ⁰, ‘ increased ’, a sense
which would require the imperfect, provehebatur. — prudentia:
here, as often, ‘legal skill ’.

28. orator: emphatic position. — senectute: causal ablative;
not ‘in age ', but ‘owing to age ⁹. — omnino—sed tamen: ‘no
doubt—but still '. Omnino (literally, ‘ altogether’) has two almost
exactly opposite uses — (1) the affirmative, cf. 93 (2) the concessive,
which we have here and in 45. The circumstance which is contrasted
with the admitted circumstance is usually introduced by sed tamen or
sed as in 45, but in Lael. 98 by the less emphatic autem, while in Lael.
69 there is no introductory particle. -— canorum .. . senectute:
canorum implies the combination of power with clearness in a voice.
For the mixture of metaphors in canorum splendescit edd. quote Soph.
Phil. 189 ἀχὼ τηλεφανής; Cic. De Or. 2,60 illorum ta ctu orationem
meam quasi colorari. nescio quo pacto: literally, ‘I know
not on what terms '3 quite interchangeable with nescio quo modo ; cf.
82. A. 334, e; G. 469, Rem. 23 H. 529, 5, 3). — adhuc non: pur·
posely put for nondum, because more emphasis is thus thrown both
on the time-word and on the negation. The common view that non-
dum was avoided because it would have implied that Cato expected to
lose the canorum is certainly wrong. — et videtis : ‘ though you see
my years '. The adversative use of et for autem or tamen after the
negative is not very uncornmon in Cicero, but there are few exam·

 

ples of the usage in the speeches. Cf. Lael. 26 et quidquid ‚· so some-
times que as above, 133 also Lael. 30 ut nullo egeat suaque omnia in
se posita iudicet. seni: Madvig’s em. for senis. In Leg. 1, 11 allu-
sion is made to the great change which advancing years had wrought
in Cicero’s own impassioned oratory. He was no doubt thinking of
that change when he wrote the words we have here. sermo:
‘style of speaking ’3 a word of wider meaning than oratio, which only
denotes public speaking. quietus et remissus: ‘subdued and
gentle '. The metaphor in remissus (which occurs also in 81) refers to

the loosening of a tight·stretched strin'g ς cf. intentum etc. in 37 with
