102 NOTEs ‘ro CATO MA1oR. [56-

Sestio 143, etc. — appetentem :=quia appetebat ; so occupatum =
cum occupasset. viatores: literally ‘ travellers '‚ so ‘messengers '.
They formed a regularly organized corporation at Rome and were in
attendance on many of the magistrates. Those officers who had· the

 

fasces had also lictors, who, however, generally remained in close at-
tendance and were not despatched on distant errands. The statement
of Cic. in the text is repeated almost verbatim by Plin. N. H. 18, 21.
miserabilis: ‘to be pitied’. The word does not quite answer
to our ‘ miserable ’. — agri cultione : a rare expression, found else·
where only in Verr. 3, 2363 then not again till the ⁸ Fathers ’. — haud

 

- scio an nulla: since haud scio an is affirmative in Cicero, not negative

as in some later writerS, nulla must be read here, not ulla. Cf. 73
haud scio an melius Ennius, ‘ probably Ennius speaks better ’ς also 74
incertum an hoc ipso die, ‘ possibly to·day '. Roby, 22563 G. 459, Rem.;
H. 529, II. 3, 2), n. 2. -- quam dixi : =de qua dixi, as in 53. —-
saturitate: the word is said to occur nowhere else in Latin. —-
quidam: i. e. the authors of the tertia vituperatio senectutis, whom
Cato refutes in 39, 59. -- porco gallina: these words are used
collectively, as rosa often is; so Fin. 2, 65 potantem in rosa Thorium.
— iam: ‘further ’. — succidiam alteram: ‘a second meat-
supply ’. The word seems to be connected with caedo, and probably
originally meant ‘slaughter'. In a fragment of Cato preserved by
Gellius 13, 24, 12 (in some editions 13, 25, 12) we find succidias huma-
nas facere. Varro, R. R. 2, 14 has the word in the sense of ‘meat ⁹.
— conditiora tacit: ‘ adds a zest to ’ς cf. condita in 10. — super-
vacaneis operis: ‘by the use of spare time ’ς literally ‘by means of
toils that are left over ’, i. e. after completing the ordinary work of
the farm.

5⁷. ordinibus: cf. 59 ordines. brevi praecidam: ‘ 1 will
cut the matter short '. For praecidam (sc. rem or sermonem) cf. Acad.
2, 133 praecide (sc. sermonem) ; t'or brevi (= ‘in brief '‚ ἐν βραχεῖ) cf. De
” Or. 1, 34 ne plura consecter comprehendam brevi. usu uberius:
cf. 53 fructu laetius . . . aspectu pulchrius. ad quem . . . retardat:
some have thought that there is zeugma here, supposing ad to be
suited only to invitat, not to retardat. That this is not the case is
clear from such passages as Caes. B. G. 7, 26, 2 palus Romanos ad
insequendum tardabat (= tardos fhczebat) Cic. Sull. 49 nullius amic-itia

ad pericula propulsanda impedimur. On fruendum see Madvig, 421, a,
Obs. zand265, Obs. 23 G. 428, Rem. 3, exc.; H. 544,2, ιι. 5.-ἰιι-
