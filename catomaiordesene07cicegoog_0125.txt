Cato was censor in 184. A reference to Livy 39, 43, 2 will show that

Cicero borrows his account of Flamininus' crime from the old annalist '

Valerius Antias. Livy also quotes (39, 42, 7) an account of the matter
given by Cato himself in a speech, which is even more disgraceful to
Flamininus. eicerem: the phrase commonly used is not eicere,
but movere, aliquem senatu. Notare and nota (censoria) are technically
used of degradation or disfranchisement inflicted by the censors. For
the spelling see Roby, 144, 23 A. 10, d3 H. 36, 4 and foot·note 1. —
fuisset: for the mood see A. 3423 G. 6663 H. 529, 11. and n. 1, 1); for
the tense see Roby, 1491; A. 3²4· a; G. 233, 23 H. 471, 4. —- cum
Gallia: not ‘when he was consul in Gaul' but ‘when he was in
Gaul during his consulship ’. Cum with the imperfect or pluperfect
subjunctive often has a sense differing very little from that of cum
with the imperfect or pluperfect indicative. No doubt when the usage
originally arose, the clause with cum was regarded as expressing the
cause of the action or event denoted by the principal verb; here the
presence of F. in Gaul might be regarded as a cause of the crime. It
is more than doubtful, however, whether in actual use the subjunctive
in these phrases continued to carry with it to Latin readers any idea
of cause. See Roby, 1720, Kennedy‚ 2115 also A. 32 5, 323 and foot-
note 13 G. 586 with Rem.; H. 521, 11. 2 and foot-note 1. — exora·
tus est: ‘was persuaded’; cf. Liv. 39, 43. — securi feriret: the
story was that L. Flamininus himself acted as executioner. -— eorum
qui... essent: the subjunctive because of the class-notion, ‘of such
persons as were ’. ——- Tito censore: i. e. in 189 13.c.; see n. on 1.
-— Flacco: L. Valerius Flaccus was the life-long friend of Cato,
and his colleague in the consulship and in the censorship. He en·
tirely favored Cato’s political views. See Introd. -— imperi dede-
cus: Flamininus was at the time Roman governor of the district.

43. audivi e: Cic. uses audire ex, ab, and de aliquo, almost indif-
ferently. porro: ‘in turn ’3 literally ‘farther on ’, here = “farther
back ’ς cf. Livy 27, 51. ——- C. Fabricium: see n. on 15. —- Cinea:
the famous diplomatist, minister of Pyrrhus. He was a pupil of De-
mosthenes and himself one of the most famous orators of his time.
Cineas was the ambassador who tried to negotiate peace on the occa-
sion mentioned in 16. — se sapientem profiteretur: the omission
of esse is common in such phrases; e. g. Fin. 5, 13 Strato physicum se
voluit. EpicuruS, who is here meant (born 342 13.c., died 270), was
blamed for calling himself σοφός οι· sapiens. Others„ says Cicero, who
