84] NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. 117

exceptionally, non conabantur nisi cernerent for non conati essent nisi
vidissem. — cernerent: see n. on 13 quaereretur. —- ut . . . glorier:
in Arch. 30 Cic. makes the same reflections in almost the same words
about his own achievements. — aliquid: see n. on 1 quid.

P. 84.—si isdem etc.: cf. Arch. 29 si nihil animus praesentiret
dimicaret. — aetatem ε =vitam. — traducere: d. Tusc. 3, 2 5
volumus hoc quod datum est vitae tranquille placideque traducere. ——
nescio quo modo: A. 210, f, Rem.; G. 469, Rem. 23 H. 529, 5, 3).
—- erigens se: Acad. 2, 127 erig-imur, elatiores fieri videmur. --
haud . .. niteretur: in Cicero’s speeches haud scarcely occurs except
before adverbs and the verb scio ; in the philosophical writings and in
the Letters before many other verbs. —immortalitatis gloriam:
so Balb. 16 sempiterni nominis gloriam. Cf. also Arch. 26 trahimur
omnes studio laudi-5 et optimus quisque maxime glorta ducitur.

83. non videre : either non vielere or non item was to be expected,
as Cicero does not often end sentences or clauses with non. — colui
et dilexi: so 26 coluntur et dilig-untur. — videndi : Cic. for the
most part avoids the genitive plural of the gerundive in agreement
with a noun, and uses the gerund as here. Meissner ndtes that Latin
has no verb with the sense ⁴ to see again ’, which a modern would use
here. —- conscripsi: in < the Origines. —- quo ε = ad quos ,· see n.
on 12 fore unde. — Pelian: a mistake of Cicero’s. It was not
Pelias but his half-brother Aeson, father of Iason, whom Medea made
young again by cutting him to pieces and boiling him in her enchanted
cauldron. She, however, induced the daughters of Pelias to try the
same experiment with their father3 the issue, of course, was very dif-
ferent. Plautus, Pseud. 3, 2, 80 seems to make the same mistake. --
siquis deus: the present subjunctive is noticeable3 strictly, an im-
possible condition should require the past tense, but in vivid passages
’ an impossible condition is momentarily treated as possible. So Cic.
generally says si rew'vzkcat aliquis, not rew'vixeret. —— decurso spa-
tio: ‘when 1 have run my race’. See n. on 14. Lucretius 3, 1042
oddly has decurso l u m i ne vitae. -- ad carceres a calce: carceres
were the barriers behind which the horses and cars stood waiting for
the race: calx (γραμμή). literally ⁴ a chalked line ⁹, was what we should
call ‘the winning post '. Cf. Lael. 1013 Tusc. 1, 15 nunc video calcem
ad quam cum sit decursum, nihil sit praeterea extimescendum.

, 84. habeat: concessive. A. 266, c; G. 2573 H. 484, 3. — multi
et ei docti: as N agelsbach, Stilistik § 2 5, 5, remarks, Cic. always
