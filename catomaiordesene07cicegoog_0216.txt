· 48 NOTES To LAELIUS. [6

-- modo: ‘a little while since ’3 the expression is somewhat loose
since Cato died in ¹49 Β. c. 3 cf. the use of nuper in 13, 24. Cf. n. on
C. M. 27· —-- L. Acilium: supposed to bc the person mentioned
by Cic. Leg. 2, 59 as a commentator on the ΧΠ tables, and probably
a contemporary of Cato. By some he is thought to be the person
named by Liv. 40, 31, 1 as commander of the left wing of the Roman
army at the battle of Aebura in 181 Β. c. Some read in our passage
L. Atilius, a name about which nothing is known. — uterquez sc.

sapiens appellatus est or hahuit hoc nomen sapientie. -— alio quodam ·

modo: ‘in a somewhat different way’3 supply in thought atque tu.
Cf. 2 5 aliud quoddam ,· 7 and 74 alio quodam modo. Quidam (like
quasi in 3) is often used to indicate that the word to which it is at-
tached does not actually represent the writer's meaning. In the pas·
sages quoted above quodam, quoddam etc. indicate that alio, aliud etc.
are too strong for Cicero's meaning. On the other hand, in 29, 45,
75, 59 the parts of quidam used show that Cicero cannot find terms
strong enough, and that the terms used are only make-shifts. The
indefinite τὶς is used in the same two ways in Greek. — prudens
in iure: Seyffert rightly points out that Cic. does not use prudens
with a genitive. The phrase iuris· prudens (for iuris· pm'tus or con-
sultus) is not Latin, though iuris· prudentia occurs, as in De Or. 1,
256, and though jurisconsults are styled prudentes. Cic. has impru-
dens with gen. in De Inv. 2, 95, also prudens ad in pro Font. 43; and
prudentia often both with gen. and with in and abl. See Holland,
Jurisprudence, page 2, with notes and references. — multarum
rerum usum: ‘a manifold experience ⁹. Liv. 39, 40, 4 says of him
nulla ars neque privatae neque publicae rei gerendae ei deficit. ——
multa eius . . . ferebantur: ‘ many instances where both in the senate
and in the forum he displayed either wisc foresight, or firm conduct.
or shrewdness in reply, were on every tongue’. ⁴ The chief reference
in responsa is to Cato's farne as a lawyer. According to old Roman
custom he sat at home in the early morning. on purpose to resolve
the legal difficulties of all who chose to consult him. This was tech-
nically called ius respondere. — quasi: ‘almost'3 cf. n. on 3. —
iam: i. e. even before his death. sapientis: the Latins said
nomen iustitiae, vox fortitudinis, appellatio prudentis etc. where we use
apposition—‘the name justice ’‚ ‘the word courage’, ‘the title skil-
ful ⁹. A. 214‚f; G. 3593 H. 396, VI. Cf. 92 nomen amicitiae, and for
the sense C. M. 5 sapientiam ...cognomines Note that the same term
