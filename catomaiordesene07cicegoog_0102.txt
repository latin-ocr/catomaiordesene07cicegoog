66 noi-Es To CATO MA1oR. [17-

very slightly3 the former means rather speed of movement in one line,
the latter rather power of rapid motion with frequent change of direc-
tion. The emphatic word in this clause is corporum. Ct. Off. 1, 79
honestum ...animi efficitur non corporis· viribus. -— consilio . . . sen-
tentia: consilio, advice3 auctoritate, weight of influence; sententia, an

 

opinion or vote for-mally given. quibus: in twofold relation3
with orbari, abl. of separation, with augeri, of specification-

18. nisi forte: ironical, used.to introduce a possible, but absurd
objection to something which has gone before. The verb that fol-
lows is always in the indicative. miles etc.: ‘ as common soldier ’ς
see n. on 10. —in vario genere: we use the plural, ‘in different
kinds ’. Cf. Acad. 2, 3 in omni genere belli ,⁰ Deiot. 12 in omni genere
bellorum. — cessare: cf. n. on 13. -- at senatui etc.= exactly the
same ideas are expressed, with the same mention of Cato’s activity,
in Off. 1, 79. —· male cogitanti: ‘which has now for a long time
been plotting mischief ’3 A. 290, ας G. 671, 2²13 Η. 549, 44 467, 111.
2. Cf. pro Sulla 70 nefizrie cogitare ,· for the use of the adverb see
n. on ,16 sic. On Cato’s attitude toward Carthage see Introd. —
vereri: the construction is unusual. Vereor regularly takes after it
an accusative, or else a clause with ne or ut. A passage much re·
sembling this is Rab. Post. 10 amnes qui aliquid de se verebantur ‚· cf.
also Att. 10, 4, 6 de vita sua metuere ‚· Verg. Aen. 9, 207 de te nil tale
verebar ‚⁰ in all these examples the ablative with de denotes the quarter
threatened, not, as here, the quarter from which the threat corneS.
—- exscisam: from exscindo ; most edd. excisam, but to raze a
city is urbem exscindere not excidere ; e. g. Rep. 6, 1 1 Numantiam

exffgfdguam palmam etc.= a prophecy after the event, like that in

 

Rep. 6, 11 avi relliquias, the finishing up of the Punic wars. For the
use of relliquias cf. Verg. Aen. 1, 30 Troas relliquias Danaum atque
immitis Achilli; ib. 598; ib. 3, 87. tertius: so all our MSS.
This places the elder Scipio’s death in 183. which agrees with Livy's
account in 39, 50, 10. But. the year before Cato’s censorship was 185
not 183, hence some edd. read quintus and some sextus in place of
tertius.

P. 9. ·- novem annis: as Cato's consulship was in 195 these words
also apparently disagree with tertius above. Novem annispost means
nine full years after, i. e, 185 not 186; cf. 42 septem annis post. ——-
enim: implies that the answer ‘no’ has been given to the question.
