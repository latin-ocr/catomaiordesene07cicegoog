xxvi INTRODUCTION.

(b). Old men, especially those of learning and cul-
ture, ought not to sear death ......
Because, that which is according to nature is
good, and it is natural for old men to die (70—73) 3
the process of dying is brief and almost painless
(74); even young men and those without learn-
ing often set the example of despising death
(75); and old age, just as the other periods
of life, has finally its season of ripeness and.
satiety (76).

(c). Death is probably the gateway to a happy im·
mortality .............
Tending towards proof of this are the argu-
ments stated in Plat03 viz. the rapidity os the
mind's action, its powers of memory and inven-
tion, its sels-activity, indivisible nature and pre-
existence (78); also the argumentS, attributed
to Cyrus, based upon the soul’s immateriality,
the posthumous fame of great men and the
likeness of death to sleep (79-81); the instinc-
tive belief in immortality‚ so strong as even to

. form an incentive sor action (82); and, finally,
the speaker's own longing after immortality and
hope of union with those whom he once knew

and loved (83-85).
