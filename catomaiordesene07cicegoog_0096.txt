60 NOTES To CATO MAIOR. [13

Panathenaea, is among the works of Isocrates which we still possess.
In c. 1 Isocrates says τοῖς ἔτεσι ἐνενήκοντα καὶ τετταρσίν, ὃν ἐγὸ τυγ-
χάνω γεγονός. vixitque: ‘ and yet he lived ’. The que here has
a slight adversative force, as is often the case with et. Cf. n. on 28,
43, 73. —- Gorgias: the greatest of the sophistS, born at Leontini
in Sicily about 48 5 Β. c.; his death took place, according to the vary·
ing accountS‚ in 380, 378, or 377. In his old age he lived in Thessaly,
where Isocrates studied with him: see Or. 1763 Fin. 2, 1. For the
adjective Leontinus placed before the name rather than after cf. 43
Thessalo Cinea. centum et septem annos: Kennedy, Grani„
ᾗ 34, vii, c, sayS, ‘in compound numbers above 100 the larger number,
with or without et, generally precedes the smaller'3 cf. Roby, Vol. 1,
p. 443. cesso: does not correspond in meaning with our ‘cease ’,
i. e. ‘to come to a standstill ’ς cesi-o is ‘ 1 am in a state of rest ⁹, ‘ 1 am
idle ’. —- quaereretur: the past tense, though the principal verb,
inquit, is in the present, because the present is the historical present
and so equivalent to a past tense. Cf. Roby, 1511—15143 Kennedy,
229, 2. A. 287, e: G. 511, Rem. 13 H. 495, II. The idiom by which
the imperfect stands where we· should expect a tense of completed
action, should be noticed3 cf. Tusc. 2, 60 quem cum rogaret, respondit.
The explanation of the imperfect in such cases is that it marks out,
more clearly than the pluperfect would, the fact that the action of the '
principal verb and the action of the dependent verb are practically
contemporaneous. In our passage if quaesitum esset had been written
it would have indicated merely that at some quite indefinite time after

 

 

 

the question was putithe answer was given. Cf. N. D. 1, βο auctore .

.. . obscurior. -— cur . . . vita: a hint at suicide, which the ancients
thought a justifiable mode of escape from troubles, particularly those
of ill health or old age. See n. on 73 vetat Pythagoras. Esse in vim
is stronger than vivere ; cf. Qu. Fr. 1, 3, 5. ——nihil habeo quod
accusem: ⁸ 1 have no reason to reproach’. Cf. the common phrase
quid est quod. . ..Ρ Quod, adverbial acc. A. 240, a: G. 331, R. 33 H.
378, 2. For mood of accusem see H. 503, I. n. 2, and references on 12
dzkcerem. ——- praeclarum responsum: est is not required, because
responsum is in apposition to the last part of the preceding sentence.
Similar appositions occur in Laelius, 67, 71, 79. — docto: applied
especially to philosophers, but also to poets. The word implies cul·
tivation as well as mere knowledge ; ‘ a learned man ’, merely as such.
is ‘homo litteratus’ .· cf. n. on 54.
