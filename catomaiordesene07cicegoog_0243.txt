30] NOTES 'ro LAEmus. 75

1, 1, 60 laic murus aheneus esto nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa.
— nullo: Cic. uses the abl. aud gen. of nullus as substantiveS, to
replace the abl. and gen. of nemo, which were not in use. He avoidS, ·
however, the use of nullus, nulli, nullum as substantives, and even
prefers nemo homo, sapiens etc. to nullus homo etc. Nor does Cic.
write nulli (nom. plur.) by itself, since nemo expresses the same
sense. Generally the Republican and Augustan writers agree with
Cic. in his treatment of nemo and mullus. See Madvig, 913 G. 304,
end; H. 457, 2. — suaque etc.: for the sense cf. 7. For que see
n. on 21 virosque. — quid enim ? Like our exclamation ‘why,
nowl’ — Africanus indigens. the σοφός or sapiens of the Stoic
system was αὐτάρκης, sufficient for himself. Chrysippus (Seneca
Ep.. 9) drew a fine distinction, that there was nothing the wise man
needed, though there were many things it was advisable fior him to
have—nulla re indigere et tamen multis ille rebus opus esse. Cf.

 

Plato, Lysis 21 5 Β. indigens: the omission both of an interrog·
ative particle and of erat renders the question more emphatic. —
ac: ‘and assuredly’; ac or atque at the outset of a sentence often
introduces a statement emphatically. Cic. and the other writers of
the best period never use nec...quidem, the place of which is often
taken by ac, or et, or atque followed by ne. . . quidem. — ego: sc.
dilexi, to be supplied from dilexit. Cf. Phil. 2, 38. — virtutis
eius: the use of a genitive dependent on another is commonest in
Cic. when, as here, the dependent genitive is a pronoun. Cf. 37
illius fhroris. — opinione .. .habebat: a somewhat roundabout
mode of expression. Cf. Att. 7, 2, 5 de opinione et seq. for-
tasse non nulla: mark the show of modesty. -— habebat...di-
lexit: the change of tense should be observed; the imperfect denotes
that Africanus was some time in coming to his conclusions about
Laelius; dilexit points to the moment his decision took effect. -—-
multae et magnae: when two adjectives are in agreement with the
same noun Cic. generally connects them with et, where English idiom
would often require them to be put side by side. When multus is
one of two adjectives the conjunction is rarely left out (cf. Greek
usage -πολλὰ καὶ κακά), but if multus is one of three adjectives the
et sometimes disappears. Cf. Verr. 5, 119 multi et graves dolores,
but Fam. 5, 17, 3 multis· fornii-simis atque optimis· viris ; Pro Imp. Cn.
Pomp. 6. multa...magna et gravia bella. causae diligendi: a
somewhat pleonastic phrase; it would have been enough to say that
