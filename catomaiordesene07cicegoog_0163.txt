His gentleness and affability were great.² His cheerfulness and
humorousness were famous.2

During his life and aster 'nis death Laelius bore the title sapiens
or ‘the wise’,⁸ a title which implies more of practical than of
intellectual wisdom‚ though it would not have been given to any
one who was destitute of culture and literary excellence. Alto-
gether Laelius is Cicero‘s typical example of the best results of
cultivation acting on a character which exhibited in their fullest
extent the ideal Roman virtues. He is introduced as an inter·
locutor into two other dialogmes, the Cato Maior with Scipio, and
the De Re Publica along with Scipio, Fannius, and Scaevola.

The friendship of Laelius and Scipio was one of the most
famous in antiquity. Laelius, says Cicero, reverenced Scipio as
a god; Scipio looked up to Laelius, his senior, as a parent.⁴
rhe views of friendship which Laelius gives in the dialogue
are said by him to be mainly those of Scipio.

(2.) Scaev02a.⁵ Scaevola belonged to a family of lawyers,⁸
and was himself exceedingly distinguished for his knowledge of
the law. He was born about 157, and lived till 88 nc. In 121
he was praetor, and governor of Asia. On his return a mali-
cious prosecution was set on foot against him on a charge of
malversation (repetundarum), but on this he was acquitted.
Soon afterwards he was elected consul for the year 117. He
seems to have had but little political ambition‚ though owing
to his high character and his freedom from partisanship he
exercised in the senate and in private a great political influence.
His house was daily thronged by the leading men of Rome.⁷
