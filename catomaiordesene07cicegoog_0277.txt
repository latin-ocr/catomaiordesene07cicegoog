97] NOTES To LAELms, 109

43, in which last passage it is called aureola) maintained that the state
had no right to control the order of religious observance. A curious
method was adopted to get over this objection. The election to priest-
hoods was at an assembly of a minority (17) of the 35 tribeS, the par·
ticular tribes which took part in it being determined by lot. While,
theoretically, a resolution of the minority of the nation had no binding
effect, and therefore could not be offensive to the godS, still in practice
the colleges were bound to appoint the persons so nominated, though
the form of cooptatio was gone through. The colleges of priests had
great influence in politicS, hence the aristocrats desired to keep the
offices in their own hands. — ad populi beneficium: magistracies
are often called bengfice'a populi Romani. primus instituit etc.:
the interpretation of this passage is difficult. Plutarch, Life of C.
Gracchus, c. 5, tells the tale of C. GracchuS, and assigns to the act a
democratic purpose. Our passage certainly seems to countenance
Plutarch in this, but Lange, Ro‘mische Alterthiimer 11², 443, denies
that the act had any political aim. He connects it with a change in
the voting at public assemblieS. This originally took place in the
comitium, which formed a small part of what was ordinarily called

 

the forum. Lange thinks that when the voting was transferred from
the comitium to the saepta (enclosures) the speakers naturally turned
their backs on the comitium and faced the saepta, the rostra being
placed between them. The matter is far from clear, and Lange’s
explanation seems scarcely to be consistent with this passage. -—
agere cum populo: the technical phrase tor the laying of matters
before the people in their assemblieS. — vendibilem: ‘plausible ’ς
lit. ‘salable'. So Brut. 174 vendibilis orator; Fin. 1, 12 nam ut sint
illa vendibiltbra, haec uberiora certe sunt. — praetore me: as the
regular age {or the praetorship was 40, Laelius was probably born
about 186 Β. c. — re . . . auctoritate: since Laelius was not consul,
he carried his case on its merits and not from the auctoritas conferred
by office, which was then not summa.

P. 86. — 97. adumbratis: adumbrare is ‘to give in outline, or
incompletely ’ς the reference here ιε to misleading the people, not by
actual lieS, but by partia] presentation of the truth, quod valet si modo
ill ustratum ..s-t. illustratum: contrasts exactly with adum-
bratis above. tota: tota‘ not told. — perpenditur: ‘is judged⁸.
Perpendere is here the equivalent of metiri in 21: the ablative con·
struction similarly follows on metiri there and on iudicare in 74. —
