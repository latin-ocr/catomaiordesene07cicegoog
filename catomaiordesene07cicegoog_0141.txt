61] NOTES To CATO MAIOR. 105

cf. n. on 21. -- aetate: here =the vigorous period of life3 cf. bona
aetas in 48. —— cursus honorum: ‘ official career ’. — huius: ille
and hic are not often found in the same sentence referring to the same
person. Eius would have been more regular here. —— media: cf. n.
on 33 constantis aetam.

P. 26. — apex: ‘ the crown ’, ‘ the highest glory ’- The word meant
originally ⁸ knot ', being connected with ap-tus ‹xp-im· ap-ere and other
words containing the idea of binding fast or grasping. It was prop-
erly applied to the olive-twig bound round with wool, which was stuck
in the cap worn by the flamines and salii. It is sometimes employed
to translate διάδημα (a word originally of similar meaning), the royal
insigne, as in Horace, Odes, 3, 21, 2ο reg-um apices, with which cf.
Odes, 1, 34, 14. The word is scarcely found elsewhere in a meta-
phorical sense. Our passage is imitated by Ammianus Marcellinus
(a great imitator of Cicero) 27, 7, 2 Rnfinus velut apicem kqncratae
senectutis praetendens.

61. Metello: see n. on 30. -- A. Atilio Calatino: consul in
258 13.c. and again in 2 54; dictator in 249, censor in 247· Cicero
classed him with old heroes like Curius and Fabricius (Plane. 60).
His tomb was on the via Appia outside the Porta Capena, close to the
well-known tomb of the Scipios (see Tusc. 1, 13). —in quem . ..
elogium: ‘in whose honor there is the inscription ’. With in quem
= de quo cf. the occasional occurrence of κατά τινος in the sense of
rep! τινος. - elogium: Greek ἐλεγεῖον (so Curtius)= for the rep-
resentation of ε by 0 cf. oliva with ἔλαια, and Plautus’ lopadas for λέπα-
δας. But cf. Roby, 929, d. — hunc etc.= the inscription (which is
quoted by Cicero also in Fin. 2, 116) is strikingly like that on the
tomb of Scipio Barbatus which has actually come down to ua, and
thus begins (Ritschl's recension) z

hanc cino ploirime cosentiont Romai
duonoro optumo ficis-e viro virore

i. e. hunc unum plurimi consentiunt Romae bonorum optimum suth-re
virum virorum. Ritschl thus completes the elogium of Atilus, by
comparison with others still preserved: dictator (ending the second
line), Consul, censor, aedilis hic ficit apud vos. But Cicero's words

(notum ...s-epulcro) seem to imply a longer inscription than one of
three lines; the analogy of the Scipionic inscriptions points the same

way. The older m‘onumental inscriptions of Rome were written in
