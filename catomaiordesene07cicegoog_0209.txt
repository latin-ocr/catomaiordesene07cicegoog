NOTES TO, LAELIUS.

 

LAELIUS DE AMICITIA (LAELms οΝ FRmanmP).
The main title is settled by Cicero's own words in De Officiis
2, 9, 31 sed ae amicitia alio libro dictum est qui inscribitur
Laeli us.¹ There are reasons, however, for supposing that the
author intended the treatise to bear also the secondary title, DE
Amcrrm. In ξ 5, addressing AtticuS, he says ut tum ad senem
senex de senectute, sic hoc libro ad amicum amicissimus
scripsi de amicitia. In like manner the Cato Maior, thus
designated in De Off 1, 42, 151, and in AdAtt. 14, 21, 3, is
described in De Div. 2, 1, 3 as liber is quemn-de senectute.2
So the MSS. give to the Brutus, called by this name in De Div.
2, 1, 4, the second title De Claris Oratoribus. Such double
titles were not uncommon. They are frequently found in an·
cient citations of Plato’s works and in Mss.; e. g. Φίληβος, περὶ
τάγαθοῦ. Varro also wrote a great number of bookS‚ called libri
logistorici, which took their first titles frorn the names of per·
sonS‚ their second titles from their subject-matter. We may
fairly conclude then that the proper complete title of the dia·

logne is LAELms DE Amen-m.
