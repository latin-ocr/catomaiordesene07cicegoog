11. THE CATO MAIOR.

1. Date and Circumstances qs Composittbn.

The date at which the Cato Maior was written can be deter-
mined with almost perfect exactness. A mention in Cicero's
work entitled De Divinationel shows that the Cato Maior pre·
ceded that work by a short time. The De Divinatione was
written after the assassination of Caesar, that is, after the 15th
of March in the year 44² Again, the Cato Maior is mentioned
as a recent work in three letters addressed by Cicero to Atticus.⁸
The earliest of these letters was written on or about the 12th
of May, 44⁴ We shall hardly err, therefore, if we assume that
Cicero composed the Cato Maior in April os the year 44⁵ This
agrees also with slight indications in the work itself. In the
dedicatory introduction Cicero speaks of troubles weighing
heavily on himself and Atticus.⁶ Any one who reads the let-
ters to Atticus despatched in April, 44, will have little doubt
that the troubles hinted at are the apprehensions as to the
course of Antonius, from whom Cicero bad personally some·
thing to sear. Atticus was using all the influence he could
bring to bear on Antonius in order to secure Cicero’s safety;
