quotes a saying of Solon ε φίλους μὴ ταχὺ κτῶ · οὓς δ’ tn nm, μὴ

brabantinas«. Aristot. Eth. Nic. 9, 3 discusses the causes which may
justify the dissolution of friendships. —— tempus: καιρόν, an occa·
sion.

P. 24. — 61. sine ulla exceptione: attributive. — aut caput
agatur aut fama: for the arrangement of the words cf. n. on 8 cum
etc. Caput is status, or condition regarding civil rights, which in the
Roman Law was viewed with reference to liberty (status libertatis),
citizenship (status civitam), and domestic position (status familiae).
See Hadley’S, or Hunter’S, Introd. to Roman Law. The exases alluded
to are those which might lead to deminutio captus, the loss of civil
rights. Infirma the reference is to trials involving infamia as part of
the punishment which may result from thern. — declinandum de
via sit: on the nice question of casuistry, how far one is to condone
the wrong doings of a friend, Laelius is conveniently vague, as Gellius
in his criticism of this passage (Noct. Att. 1, 3, 14) complains, The
passage becomes the more unsatisfactory when we go back to Laelius’
first principle in 18 nisi in bonis amicitiam esse non posse. Aristotle's
discussion of the matter (Eth. Nic. 9, 4, 3) is more careful though still
vague. Roman popular morality required a man to go much greater
lengths in assisting a friend than would be allowed even by the popular
morality of our tirne3 this is expressed in the words modo ne su m m a
turpitudo sequamr. — possit: subjunctive of characteristic. Qua-
tenus is here a relative adverb. Roby, 1680, 1686. —-— nec . .. fama:
i. e. propter amicum. —- res: here = publicas res. telum: for
the metaphorical use cf. the old line quoted by Cic. in Fam. 7, 16, 1:
usquequaque sapere oportet: id erit telum acerrimum. -— blanditiis et
assentando: it is not often that Cic. makes the gerund thus range
with a noun, though the usage is exceedingly common in Tacitus and
his contemporaries. Cf. Fin. 3, 34.

62. cuius .. . de amicitia: ‘from whom entirely proceeded the dis·
course concerning friendship’3 not ‘whose whole discourse was of
friendship'. —- diligentiores: ‘more painstaking'‚ i. e. ‘than in

 

friendship ’. — capras et ovis: imitated from Xenoph. Mem. 2, 4,
4: 2, 45 ¹· — non posse dicere: n. on 193 cf. also 73 potuit... non
potuit. —in amicis: asyndeton: cf. n. on 13 tum. -“- quasi

signa quaedam et notas: a tentative translation of the Greek σημεῖον
or κριτήριον, which Cic. elsewhere renders by iudicium (Academ. pas·
sim) or nota merely (Acad. 2, 84) ; cf. also N. D. r, 12 certo iudicandi
