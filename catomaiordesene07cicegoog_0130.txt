or wdaliczh annually appointed a magis-ter cenarum whose duty :t was
to attend to the club-dinners during his year of office and no doubt to
preside at thern. That some office is meant more important than that

at which the cup began to circulate was summus, the next medius, the
last imus. For a summo cf. da (sc. bibere) a summo in Plaut. Asin. 5,
