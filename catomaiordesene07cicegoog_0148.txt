the Pythagoream Cic. therefore refers the doctrine to Pythagoras
Cf. Tusc. 1, 745 Rep. 6, 15· The Stoics held the same view about
suicide, which they authorized in extreme caseS, but much less freely
than is commonly supposed; cf. Sen. Ep. 117, 22 nihil mihi videtur
turpius quam optare mortem. See Zeller, StoicS, EpicureanS, and
Sceptics‚ Ch. 12, c (2); cf. also Lecky, Hist. ot European MoraIS, I.
p. 228 et seq. (Am. ed.) -- imperatoris...praesidio: here Cic.
seems to understand Plato’s φρουρᾷ as referring to warfare3 in Tusc.
and Rep. he understands it of a prison. —- sapientis: Solon was one
of the ‘ Seven Sages of Greece’. elogium: the distich is pre·
’ served by Plutarch, and runs thus: μηδέ μοι ἄκλαυστος θάνατος μόλοι, ,
ἀλλὰ φίλοισι liuhad-roim θανὼν ἄλγεα καὶ στοναχάς. Cic. thus trans·
lates it in Tusc. 1, 117 Mors mea ne careat lacrimis, linquamus amicis
Μαινονεηι, ut celebrent fimera cum gemitu. The epitaph of Ennius is
also quoted there and is declared to be better than that of Solon (cf.
Tusc. 1, 34). volt se esse carum: ‘he wishes to make out that
he is beloved ’3 volt esse carus would have had quite a different sense.

 

 

Cf. Fin. 5, 13 Strato physicum se volt, with Madvig's n. — haud
faxit ε the subject is quisquam understood
from nemo. For the form see A. 142, 128, e, 33 G. 191, 53 H. 240, 4.
The end of the epitaph is omitted here as in. Tusc. 1, 117, but is given
in Tusc. 1, 34 cur? volito vivos per ora virum. Notice the auit-
eration.

⁷4. isque: cf. n. on 13 vixitque. -— aut optandus aut nullus:
cf. 66 aut neglegenda . . . aut optanda ; nullus almost = non as in 67, but
only in the Letters does Cic. (imitating Plautus and the other drama·
tists) attach nullus in this sense to the name of a particular person;
e. g. Att. 11, 24, 4 Philotimus nullus venit. sed . . . esse : ‘ but we
must con this lesson from our youth up ’. For the passive sense of
meditatum cf. n. on 4 adeptam. In Tusc. 1, 74 Cic„ imitating Plato,
says tota philosophorum vita commentatio mortt's est. So Seneca, tota
vita dt‘scendum est mori. sine qua . . . nemo potest: these words
bring the position of Cicero with regard to death wonderfully near
that oi Lucretius ς the latter argues that for peace of mind one must
believe ‘ nullum esse sensum post mortem ’ ; the former's lesson is ‘aut
nullum esse sensum aut optandum ’. timens ε = si quis timet ; the
subject of poteritis the indefinite quis involved in timens. A. 310, a;
G. 6703 H. 549, 2. — quiz=qu0 modo, as in 4. animo con-
sistere : so in* pro Quint. 773 also mente constitere in Phil. 2, 683 Div.
