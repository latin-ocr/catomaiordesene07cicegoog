period between the first and the second Punic wars3 the most
exciting event of his younger years must have been the de-
struction at Clastidium of the vast bordes of Celts who had
swept over the northern half of Italy, almost within reach of
Rome.

Cato was of the age for military service about the time of the
battle of Lake Trasimenus, and entered the army then as a
common soldier.² The first expedition in which he is definitely
said to have taken part is that of Q. Fabius Maximus Cunctator
against Hannibal in Campania, in 2142 This Roman com-
mander was a man entirely after Cato’s beart, and became one
of his models in public life.

Before and during the early years of his soldier's life, Cato
succeeded in winning some reputation as an orator, having
practised first in the provincial courts near his home, and after-
wards at Rome.⁸ This reputation as well as his great force of
character procured for him a powerful life-long friend and patron,
M. Valerius FlaccuS, a statesman of the old Roman conservative-
democratic school of politicS‚ the leader of which was Fabius
Cunctator. Through the influence of F laccuS, possibly with the
aid of Fabius, Cato became military tribune, and served with
that rank under Marcellus in Sicily, under Fabius again at thc
capture of Tarentum in 209,⁴¹ and under C. Claudius Nero at the
battle ot the MetauruS, where he contributed materially to that
great victory.

In 204 Cato began his political career with the quaestorship.³
As he was a novus homa and a man of small private meam, it
was no small distinction that he had forced his way to office in
