292, Rem. 13 H. 450, 2, n. In facta...dicta we have the contrast
between the life of action, the πρακτικὸς βίος, which the Romans re·
'garded as the only proper life for a man of rank, and the literary or
contemplative life, the θεωρῂτικὸς βίος. The Romans looked on all
departments of thought and literature as graceful adjuncts to a life
of activity, but nothing more. Cf. n. on 16 sumus otiosi· -— ne-
gem: See G. 598, Rem. 23 H. 509, n. 2. ——quam id recte: see
n. on C. M. 15. ——viderint sapientes: ‘how far 1 am right is for

> the wise men to consider ’. The literal rendering of viderint would

be ‘shall by and by consider ’, viderint being probably not perfect
subjunctive, but future perfect indicative. Phrases like this are
thoroughly discussed by Roby, Gr., Vol. 11. Preface, p. cvi„ and ἓ 1593.
By sapientes no doubt the Stoics are meant, who taught that men
ought to be entirely unaffected by any emotionS. either of pain or
of pleasure. -— moveor enirn ε supply desiderio from the preceding
sentence. -— confirmare: the sense is rather stronger than that of
affirmare. —— me ipse: cf. n. on 5 te epse. decessu: abl. of
cause and time. -- nihil mali etc.= the same opinion is expounded
at length in Tusc. Disp., Book 13 cf. especially ξ 111. See also the
reflections on the death of Hortensius in Brut. § 5, and Fam. 5, 16, 4
nihil mali et seq. incommodis: the word is here pointedly con·
trasted with mali. There is no doubt a slight reference to the Stoic
theory of προηγμένα and ἀποπροηγμένα. Although only virtue is
bonum, only vice malum in the eyes of the StoicS‚ still there are
such differences among other things as will incline the wise men to
desire some of them (rponypalvoe=sumenda) and reject others (ἀπο-
προηγμένα = reidenda or incommoda), his real happineSS, however,
remaining absolutely unaffected. Cf. Acad. 1, 36 and 373 see Zeller,
