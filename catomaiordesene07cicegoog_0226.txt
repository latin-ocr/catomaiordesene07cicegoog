on C. M. 3 ceteris. —idem semper, animos etc.= Cic. is think-
ing of Socrates as he appears in the dialogues of Plato, particularly
in the Phaedo, Apology, Phaedrus, and Timaeus. The principal
arguments in favor of the soul's immortality which are put into,
Socrates' mouth in the Phaedo are many times reproduced by Cic-
ero, especially in Tusc. 1, Somn. Scip. and Cato Maior. In the
words esse dtbt‘nos and reditum in caelum patrre Cic. recalls those
arguments in favor of the soul’s pre-natal existence which the Pla·
tonic Socrates usually joins with his arguments for the soul’s life
after the death of the body. -— ex corpore: used for corporibus,
since in both Greek and Latin, when a number of persons are men·
tioned and then some one thing common to them all, that thing is
often put into the singular, where our idiom would require the plural.
Cf. Tusc. 1, 40 animos, cum e corpore excesserint,· ib. 1, 72 animorum
e corpore excedentium ; C. M. 813 on the other hand, C. M. 80
animos, dum in corporibus essent etc. — optimoque . . . expeditis-
simum: cf. Tusc- 1, 40 seq.; also Plato, Phaedo 114 Β. On the
, superlative with quisque see A. 93, c; G. 3053 H. 458, ι.

14. praesagiret: on this word cf. Cic. Div. 1, 65 sagire enim sen-
tire acute est .· ex quo sagae anus quia multum scire volunt, et sagaces
dicu canes. Is {gitur qui ante sagit quam oblata res est dicitur prae-
sagire, id est, fictura ante scire. —— Philus: see Introd. p. v.
Manilius: see Introd. p. v. —-— triduum disseruit: the discourse
is represented by Cicero’s work De Re Publica. —- de re publica:
‘concerning the commonwealth', i. e. the ideal or best form of com·
monwealth. —- extremum: this neuter adj. is used as a noun fre·
quently by Cic. as below, 20: Div. 2, 91 and 103: also by Lucr.
1, 960, Livy, TacituS, etc. — fuit de: ‘treated of '. — animo-

 

rum: the plural where we use the singular, ‘the soul ’, in the abstract
sense. Immortalitas animorum also occurs in C. M. 78 where see n.,
Leg. 2, 68; aeternitas animorum in Tusc. 1, 80. -— quae: as only
the last book of the De Re Publica (comprising the Somnium Scapi-
onis) discussed the immortality of the soul, the neuter quae refers not
to the whole work, but merely to the extremum. Quod would have
been correct but inelegant. Quae is a sort of explanation of extre-
mum ‘the conclusion, Ι mean such matters as '. For the plural rela-
tive referred to a singular antecedent cf. the not uncommon phrases
ex eo genere quae (Fin. 3, 70) and ex eo numero qui with plural verb
(Arch. 31). The usage is frequently found in Greek, as Plato, Rep. 5 54⁴
