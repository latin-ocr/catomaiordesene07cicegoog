generally felt little or no admiration for wild and mountainous scenery.
Cicero had more feeling for wild picturesqueness than most Romans.

69. maximum t =caput est in 4 53 cf. ²9 quod maius est. —- su-
periorem etc.= supen'orem is explained by 70 praestantiam virtutis,
ingeni, fortunae. Cf. 32 sintque pares in amore et aequales ; also 56.
Like Cicero, Aristotle accepts equality as essential to the highest kind
of friendship‚ as in Eth. Nic. 8, 5, 5 λέγεται φιλότης ἥ ἰσότης, 8, 7, 3
ἰσότης, ὃ δὴ τῆς φιλίας εἶναι δοκεῖ. He discusses elaborately the ques-
tion how this equality is to be understood and secured in friendships
of different kinds, but he admits that there are friendships‚ such as
that of parents for children, in which it cannot be secured (8, 13, ι
τῶν μὲν δν ἰσότητι φίλων ὄντων vav δὲ καθ’ ὑπεροχήν).

p. v. — Maximum: i. e. Q. Fabius Maximus Aemilianus, the el-
dest son of Paulus MacedonicuS, and adopted into the family of the
Fabii. Africanus gave up to hitn his share in the inheritance of their
common father. See Paradoxa 48 liberalitatem Africani qui (Pauli)
hereditatis Q. Maximo fratri partem suam concessit. omnino: here
=‘no doubt ⁹, ‘indeed ⁹, ‘it is true’; so in 98, where however the
contrast is introduced by autem, as in C. M. 45 by sed, and in C. M.
28, Tuse. 2, 35 by sed tamen. — is: the insertion of a pronoun was
necessary, otherwise the subject to anteibat might have been supposed
to be Africanus, supplied from sibi. — suosque omnis etc.= see 11
liberalitate in sorores. ⁴

⁷0. sit note si followed by si, the suppositions being parallel, and
not contrasted with each other. Had they been contrasted sive-sive
