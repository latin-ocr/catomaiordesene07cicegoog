46] NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. 93

(cf. 39 where aetas= senectus), in the second place vita (for which seo
n. on 5). — neque enim t the enim refers to modice. — coetu . . .
sermonibus: for the order of the words see n. on 1 animi tui. —
metiebar: cf. n. on 43 rgferenda. — accubitionem: a vox Cicero·
niana, rarely found in other authors. —- vitae coniunctionem: ‘a
common enjoyrnent of life ’. -- tum . . . tum t here purely temporal,
‘sometimes sometimes ’ς often however = ‘both and ’ς cf. 7.
compotationem etc.= cf. Epist. ad Fam. 9, 24, 3. compotatio=
συμπόσιον; concertatio = σύνδειπνον. in eo generet see n. on 4.
id ε i. e. eating and drinking.

46. tempestivis . .. conviviis: ‘even in protracted banquets ⁹.
Those banquets which began early in order that they might last long
were naturally in bad repnte, so that the phrase tempestivum convivium
often has almost the sense of ‘a debauch’. Thus in Att. 9, 1, 3 Cic·
ero describes himself as being evil spoken of in tempestivis convivio,
i. e. in dissolute society. Cf. pro Arch. 13. The customary dinner
hour at Rome was about three o’clock in the asternoon. The word
tempestivus, which in 5 means ‘ at the right time ’‚ here means ‘before
the right time ’. So in English ‘in good time ' often means ‘too
early’. See Becker’s Gallus, p. 451 et seq. qui pauci: the sub-
stitution of the nominative of the relative for the partitive genitive
(quorum) is not uncommon. A. 216, e; G. 368, Rem. 2; H. 397, 2, n.
— pauci admodum z Cic. usually says admodum pauci rather than
pauci admodum. — vestra aetate ε -- eis qui sunt vestra aetate. cf.
n. on 26 senectus. -— sermonis sustulit: notice the indicatives
auxit, sustulit, the relative clauses being attributive, though they might
fairly have been expected here to be causal. G. 6273 H. 517, 2. In
this passage Cic. imitates Plato, Rep. 328 D. — bellum indicere:
common in the metaphorical senseg e. g. De Or. 2, 155 miror cur plu·-
losophiae prope bellum indixeris ,· Hor. Sat. 1, 5, 7 ventri indico bellum.
-- cuius est etc.: i. e. nature sanctioris a certain amount of pleas-
ure. This is the Peripatetic notion of the mean, to which Cicero often
gives expression, as belovv, 77; also in Acad. 1, 39; 2, 139'3 and in De
Off.; so Hor. Sat. 1, 1, 106 sunt certi denique fines quos ultra citraque
nequit consu-tere rectum ; cf. Od. 2, ιο. -- non intellego ne ε for the
negatives cf. nn. on 24, 27.

P. 20. - magisteria: generally explained as referring to the
practice of appointing at each dinner a ‘master of the feast ', arbiter
bibendi or συμποσιάρχης. This explanation is not quite correct
