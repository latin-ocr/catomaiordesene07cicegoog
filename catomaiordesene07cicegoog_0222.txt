54 NOTES To LAELIUS. [11

si verisimile quodsit invenm't,· Fam. 5, 18, 15 4. 5, 2 cogita quem
ad modum adhuc fortuna nobiscum egerit ,· 4, 5, 3; 4, 14, ις 9, 24, 4.
Acad. 2, 803 Verr. 3, 703 Sest. 51· — immortalitatem τ of the body
is probably meant. — optare ε used here of a desire for the impos·
sible3 sperare would have implied that the fulfilment of the wish was
possible. Cf. also n. on 18. —— vellet ι for the tense see A. 308, a;
G. 599, Rem. 13 H. 510,.n. 2. —- quod . . . esset: an instance of

Roby, 1692; A. 320, a; G⁴ 6345 11. 503, 1. —iam ε strictly belongs
to habuerunt. The word is often displaced, either, as here, to add
emphasis to it (which it gains by being put close to puero) or to make
the sentence or clause more euphonious. — puero: for this and
other references to Scipio’s life see Intr. to C. M. pp. xxi,-xxiii.
The appositive = a temporal clause, see G. 3243 H. 363, 3, 2)
adulescens: this, not adolescens (which is the participle of adoles-co),
is the correct spelling.

P. ὅ. —factus consul: some scholars wish‚ quite unnecessarily.

εκεῖ. -- suo tempore t a man is said to gain office suo tempore when
heis elected to the office at the earliest age which the law allows.
On suo see G. 295, Rem. 13 H. 449, 2. — sero: because the Nu—
mantine war had already continued eight years and had proved dis-
astrous to the Romans. See ref. above — duabusz Carthage and
Numantia, in 13.c. 146 and ¹33· — non modo...delevit: it is oi
course inaccurate to speak of blotting out something in the future,
but the expression has many parallels in every language. Delere
bellum for the more usual conficere or presstjgare b. is found also in
Nepos, Alcib. 8, 6. -—- facillimis: ‘ most affable '. — de pietate
