50] NOTES To CATO MAIOR. 97

slave of Livius, and, according to custom, took his name wnen set
free. For an account of his writings see Cruttwell's Hist. of Roman
Literature, Ch. 33 Sellar, Roman Poets of the Rep., Ch. 3. do-
cuisset: ‘had brought on to the stage ’. Docere (like διδάσκειν in
Greek, which has the same use) meant originally to instruct the per·
formers in the play. -- Centone Tuditanoque consulibus ε i. e.
in 240 Β. c. The use of que here is noticeableg wlzen a date is given
by reference to the consuls of the year it is usual to insert et (not que
or atque, which rarely occur) between the two names, if only the cogno·
mina (as here) be given. If the full names be given, then they are
put side by side without et. Cf. n. on 10. — Crassi: see n. on 27.
pontifici et civilis iuris: the ius pontificium regarded mainly
the proper modes of conducting religious ceremonial. Ius cisze, which
is often used to denote the whole body of Roman Law, here includes
only the secular portion of that Law. Cf. n. on 38. — huius P.
Scipionis z ‘the present P. Scipio '. So in 14 ln· consules ‘the present
consuls’; Rep. 1, 14 Africanus hic, Pauli filius, and often. The Ρ.
Scipio who is meant here is not Africanus, but Nasica Corculum. —-
flagrantis: ‘all aglow ’ς so ardere studio in Acad. 2, 65. -- senes=
=cum senes essent, so senem below. — suadae medullamt ‘the
essence (lit. marrow) of persuasiveness’. The lines of Ennius are
preserved by Cicero, Brut. 58. Suada is a translation of πειθώ, which
the Greek rhetoricians declared to be the end and aim of oratory.
This Cethegus was consul in 204 and in 203 defeated Mago in the N.
of Italy. — exerceri: here reflexive in meaning. A. 111, n. ις G.
209; H. 465. -—-· videbamus: see n. on 49. — comparandaet
for the idea of possibility which the gerundive sometimes has (but only
in negative sentences or interrogative sentences implying a negative
answer, and in conditional clauses) see Madvig, 420, Obs.; Roby,
1403. — haec quidem: a short summai-y of the preceding argu-
mentS, preparatory to a transition to a new subject, introduced by
venio nunc ad. The succession of two clauses both containing quidem
seems awkward, but occurs in Fin. 5, 80 and elsewhere. — hones-
turn sit: ‘does him honor ’. -- ut ante dixit in 26, where see the
notes. potest esse: Meissner (n. on 27) says that Cicero’s rule
is to say potest esse, debet esse and the like, not esse potest and the like.
It is true that esse in such cases is very seldom separated from the
word on which it dependS, but esse potest is just as common as potest

esse ,· the difference to the sense is one of emphasis only, the esse hav·-
ing more emphasis thrown on it in the latter case.
