stood out with greater prominence and distinctneSS, would in fact
have been more emphasized; cf. n. on 95 inter. Scipio gave a
legacy to his mother after her divorce (pietate), bestowed it after her
death upon his sisters (liberalitate), and gave to his elder brother
property received from his father’s estate (bonitate). — maereret
dolor is grief. as felt at the heart, luctus as expressed by material signs,
in the dreSS, for instance, maeror as expressed by the condition or
action of the sufferet, for example by the gloom on his countenance.
The following is a striking passage—Att. 12, 28, 2 maerorem minui,
dolorem nec -potui nec si possem, vellem. quid: adv. acc. -——
potuisset: A. 310, a; G. 594, 3 ; H. 507, 3, n. 7. — memini ...dis-
sereret n. on 2. Laelius and Scipio are two of the interlocutors in
the Cato Maior, and Cic. strives artfully here to give an air of reality
to the conversation he relates in that dialogue —- viriditatemz
‘freshness'. For the metaphorical use of the word cf. Verg. Aen.
6, 304 cruda deo viridtkque senectus ; Tac. Agr. 29 iuventus et quibus
cruda ac viridis senectus ,· Verg. Aen. 5, 295 viridique iuventa. ———
etiarn nunc: even in the best writers nunc occasionally goes with a
past tense, as Cic. Verr. 3, 47 quos ego campos antea nitidzksimos watk-
sem, hos ita vastatos nunc videbam ut.. . In that passage tum would
have been ambiguous after antea, so in ours tum might have been
referred by the reader to the time of the conversation between Scipi0,

 

Cato, and Laelius3 so in Liv. 3, 19, 8. But often the motive is
merely the desire to make the narrative vivid, as in Caes. B. G. 7,
62, 6 incerto nunc etiam exitu. . ..rigna intulerunt ; cf. ib. 6, 40, ὃς
Cic. Cat. 1, 95 Sallust, Iug. 109, 3.

12. vita...gloria: Cic. means that some would look on Scipio’s
life as merely showing the effect of luck or chance, while others would
think of the renown attending it and assume that Scipio deserved it.
Gloria here implies virtus. Fortuna and virtus are the two important
attributes of the Roman general; cf. Pro Balbo 9 (of Pompeius) in
quo uno ita summa fortuna cum summa virtute certavit utplus homini
quam deae tribueretur ‚· Fam. 10, 3, 2 virtute duce, comite fortuna,·
De Imp. Cn. Pom. 28. For the ablatives see Roby, 12103 A. 2533
G. 3983 H. 424. — accedere: sc. vel ad fortunam vel ad gloriam.
——moriendi sensum: moriendi is the act or process of dying3
mortis would have a different meaning and could not be substituted
here. Cf. C. M. 743 Phil. 9, 13 si quis est sensus in morte. On
Scipio's death see Intr. to C M. p. xxii. —- quo de genere mortis}
