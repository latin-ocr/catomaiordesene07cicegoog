ιο] NOTEs To LAEmUs. 65

15 natiuae &osius habitu. — ea: sc. amu-itia. not natura ,⁰ illa would
have been clearer and more usual. — hoc t = hac re ,· ‘herein'.
—- propinquitati: ‘relationship ’‚ including the relationship of
citizen to citizen as well as that of the members of a family one to
another. — non potest: Latin idiom requires the repetition of
the verb potest in the negative clause, where English idiom would
omit it. — propinquitatis: for the omitted adversative particle
(sed or the like) cf. n. on 5 Laelium... putes.

20. res: as in 17. — duos: while duo for duos is classical
(Roby, Vol. 1, p. 4423 Kennedy, ᾖ 33, V. 4) ), the weight of MSS.
evidence is in favor oi duos as the Ciceronian form. —- iungeretur:
on the tense see A. 287, ag G. 511, Rem. 2; H. 495, Ι. — enirn:
the conditions of amicitia here given are so difficult oi fulfilment that
they account for the rarity of caritas (as above inter duos aut paucos),
which is the kernel οἱ friendship. omniurn ...consensim in
15 it is said that the whole pith (omnis vis) of friendship lies in the
consensio voluntatum studiorum sententiarum. In the present passage
the objects towards which the voluntates, studia, and sententiae are
to be directed are so described as to include all things in heaven
and earth. The division of all things into res divinae and res hu·
manae belonged to everyday talk and has no reference to any philo
sophical system. Cf. the title of Varro’s greatest work, Antiquitates
rerum humanarum et divinarum ; also Iustin. Inst. 1, 1, 1, definition
of iuris-prudentia, divinarum atque humanarum rerum notitia, iusti
atque iniusti scientia. Compare with this definition of friendship
Aristode, Rhet. 2, 4 ἔστω δὴ τὸ φιλεῖν τὸ βούλεσθαί τινι ἃ οἴεται
ἀγαθά, ἐκείνου ἕνεκα, ἀλλὰ μὴ αὑτοῦ καὶ τὸ κατὰ δύναμιν πρακτικὸν
εἶναι τούτων. Cf. Eth. Nic. 2, 7, 13. Also Cic. Invent. 2, 166 ami·.
citio, voluntas erga aliquem rerum bonarum illius ipsius causa quem
diligit cum eius pari voluntate ,· Plane. 5 vetus est lex illa iustae verae-
que amicitiae ut idem amici semper velint, nec est ullum certius amicitiae
vinculum quam consensus et societas consiliorum et voluntatum ‚· Sallust,
Cat. 20 idem velle atque idem nolle, ea demum firma amicitia est.
Neither in Eth. Nic. Books 8 and 9, nor in Plato’s LysiS, is any
very exact definition of friendship attempted. —- benevolentia et
caritate: ‘kindliness and affection ’. These words are often thus
joined, as in Sest. 63 Phil. 2, 107 and 1123 Off. 1, 54. Cf. 32 benevo
lenth'ae caritatem. Cum benevolentia et caritate qualify consensio. --
haud scio an: in Cic. and the best writers this phrase is affirmative
