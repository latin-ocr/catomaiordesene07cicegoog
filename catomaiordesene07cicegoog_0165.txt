lius, himself, and Fannius on Friendship. This conversation
Cicero has freely rendered (3). He states why he has dedicated
the work to Atticus, his reasons for making Laelius the most
prominent character in the dialogue (4), and the circumstances

of the supposed conversation (5).

Introductory Conversation ........ 6—16.

Fannius opens the conversation with an allusion to Scipio
Africanus, and remarks that people are wondering how Laelius,
whom they call ‘ wise‚' bears the death of his friend (6, 7). Scaevoia

speaks to the same effect (8). Laelius, although alleging ill-health
as the cause of temporary retirement, acknowledges that he has

been deeply moved by the loss of Scipio (8-10). He finds con·
solation‚ however, in the reflection that Scipio is better off than
he (10), because, after having enjoyed the highest esteem and
honors, Scipio has passed away by a painless death, and no
doubt to a happy immortality (lt-14), while he, older in yearS,
is left behind. But still the greatest solace is the remembrance
of the close friendship between himself and Scipio (15). The
subject of Friendship having thus been touched upon, Fannius
and Scaevola unite in asking Laelius to express his views upon

it (16).

This discourse of Laelius comprises five distinct portiouS.
In two instances the transitions are gracefully made
through remarks by Fannius and Scaevola (ξς 25,
32).

(1) Remarks upon the Nature and Value of F riendship 17-25
Friendshi p is to be prized above all other things (17),
but can exist only among the good, — good not in the
Stoic‚ but in the ordinary sense (18), — and is some·
thing deeper and stronger than natural association
(19). F riendship is defined, with the statement that
virtue is its essential condition (20, 21), and its
