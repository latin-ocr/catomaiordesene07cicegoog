P. 7. —14 euius . . . feci: ‘the aforesaid ’ is in good Latin always
expressed by a parenthesis like this and not by a participle in agree·
ment with the noun. The phrases ‘ante dictus ’‚ ‘ supra dictus ’‚ belong
to silver Latin, where they are common. cf. 23 quos ante dixi. —-
sic ut etc.= the lines are from the Annals of Ennius, for which see n.
on 1. -— ecus: Ennius did not write uu, nor most likely did Cicero;
the former may have written either ecus, equos, or equs. The last form
Vahlen prints in his edition of Ennius. — spatio supremo: ‘at the
end of the racc-course ’, ‘at the goal ⁹, or it may be ‘at the last turn
round the course ’, the race requiring the course to be run round sev·
eral times; ct'. Homer's πύματον δρόμον in Iliad 23, 768. So 83 de-
curso spatio ‚· Verg. Aen. 5, 327 iamque fere spatio extremo fissique sub
ipsam finem adventabant. — vicit Olumpin: a direct imitation of
the Greek phrase νικᾶν Ὀλύμπια, to win a victory at an Olympic con·
test. So Horace Ep. 1, 1, 50 has coronari Olympia = στεφανοῦσθαι
Ὀλύμπια. The editors print Olympia, but the use of y to represent
Greek υ did not come in till long atter the time of Ennius. — senio':
differs from senectute in implying not merely old age, but the weakness
which usually accompanies it. ———- confectus: for the disregard of
the final s in scanning ct'. n. on 1, 1. 6. -— equi victoris: for the
almost adjectiva] use of the substantive metor, cf. Verg. Aen. 7, 656
m‘ctores equos ,· ib. 12, 751 venator canis ,· ib. 10, 891 ς 1 1, 89, and Georg.
2, 145 bellator equus, in Theocritus 15, 51 πολεμισταὶ ἵπποι. The femi·
nine-nouus in ·trix are freely used as adjectives both in verse and in

prose. A. 88, ες Η. 441, 3. — quem quidem: the same torm of
transition is used in 26, 29, 46, 53. The whole of this passage to sua-
sissem is an exhibition of antiquarian learning quite unnatural and
inappropriate in a dialogue. — probe meminisse potestis: cf. De
Or. 3, 194 quem tu probe meminis-te] Fin. 2, 63 L. Thm'us quem me-
minis-se tu non potes. Memini can take a persona! accusative only when
the person who remembers was a contemporary of the person remem-
bered; otherwise the gen. follows. Cf. Roby‚ 13333 A. 219, Rem.;
H. 407, n. 1. — bi consules: ‘the present consuls ’. — T. Flami-
ninus: commonly said to be the son of the great Flamininus (1, l. ι).
He was altogether undistinguished, as also were the Acilius and the
Caepio here mentioned. This passage gives the imagined date of the
dialogue as 150 Β. c. — Philippo: this was Q. Marcius PhilippuS‚
who was consul in 186 and took -part in the suppression of the great
Bacchanalian conspiracy of that year. For the next 17 years he was a
