at least a consenting party to the expulsion from Rome of Greek
teachers in 161 13.c. When in 155 the famous embassy came
from Athens consisting of Carneades the Academic, Critolaus the
Peripatetic and Diogenes the Stoic‚ Cato was a prime mover of
the decree by which they were removed from the city. Socrates
was one of Cato’s favorite marks for jestS. And this is the man
into whose mouth Cicero puts the utterances, but slightly veiled,
of Greek wisdom!

no blood relation of the conqueror of Hannibal, but the adopted
son of his son. It must be remembered, however, that adoption

The young Scipio was born about 183, and when scarce 17
years old fought with daring bravery at Pydna. While still very

through life. He was a thorough partisan of the new Greek
learning, and grouped around him in friendship all the leaders of
the Hellenistic movement. Among his dearest friends were
Polybius, the Greek statesman and historian, and later Panaetius,
the Stoic. In 151 nc. when the consuls found it difficult to enlist
officers and men for service in Spain, where great defeats had
been suffered, Scipio volunteered, and served with great distinc-
tion as military tribune. When the war with Carthage broke out he
