52 NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. [8-

so De Or. 2, 2153 ib. 3, 221 ς Leg‘. 2, 24 in quo sunt omnia.-— isto:
the use of the neuter pronoun in the oblique case as substantive is
noticeable. — Themistocles etc.: Cicero borrows the story from
Plato (Rep. 329 Ε etseq.), but it was first told by Herodotus, 8, 1²5
who gave a somewhat different version. Themistocles had received
great honors at Sparta when Athenian ambassador there3 an envious
man declaring that the honors were paid really to Athens and not to
ThemistocleS‚ the statesman answered οὔτ’ ἃν ἐγώ, ἐὼν Βελβινίτης (ι’. e.
an inhabitant of the small island of Belbina lying to the S. of Cape
Sunium) ἐτιμήθην οὕτω πρὸς Σπαρτιητέων, οὔτ’ ἃν σύ, ἄνθρωπε, ἐὼν
Ἀθηναῖοι —Seriphioz Seriphus' 1s a small island belonging to the
Cyclad group and lying almost due N. of Melos, and due E. of the
Scyllaean promontory. “ Seriphus is often taken by ancient writers as
a specimen of an insignificant community (e. g. Aristoph. Acharn. 5423
Cic. N. D. 1, 88), but it had the honor of being-one of the three island
states which refused to give earth and water to the Persian envoyS,
the other two being the adjacent islands of Melos and Siphnus (He-
rodotus, 8, 46). -—- iurgio: iurgium is a quarrel which does not go
beyond words3 rixa a quarrel where the disputants come to blows
—si ego: but further on, tu si. The contrast would certainly be
more perfect if ego si were read, as has been proposed, in place of si
ego, quod eodem modo...dici: Cic. commonly says quod ita
dicendum and the like3 see ιι. on 35 quod ni ita ficisset. Cato means
that just as Themistocles' success was due to two things, his own
character and his good fortune, so two things are necessary to make
old age endurable, viz. moderate fortune and wisdom. He then' ιιι 9
insists that of these two conditions wisdom‘ is far the more important.

cum diu multumque vixeris. literally‘ when you have lived long
and much', ι’. e. when you have not only had a long life but have done
a great deal ιιι the course of it. The phrases diu multumque, multum
et diu are common in Cic„ as below, 383 Acad. 1, 4, Div. 2, ις Off. ’

εέκς) was old -fashioned in Cicero’ s time, but forms of the sort, as
below, 39 ecfrenate, according to the evidence of the best Mss„ occur
in a good many passages. See Neue, Formenlehre, Vol. 2, pp. 766
