90 NOTEs To LAELms. [32-

cf. De Or. 3, ¹3¹ otio deffundat,- Off. 1, 106 diffluere luxuria ,⁶ Terent.
Haut. 5, 1, 73 d. luxuria et lascivia ; Tusc. 2, 52 liquescimus fha'mus-
que mollitia ,· Liv. 7, 29, 5 fluentes luxu ,· also the phrase fluxa cor-
pora, and the uses of solvi, dissolm’, frangi, debilitari and the like.
Dtffluere is rather rare, not occurring in Caesar, Nepos, Vergil, Hor·
aee or Ovid, and only once in Cicero’s speeches. The homines meant
are of course the Epicureans and Cyrenaics, as in 46. — habent
cognitam: see n. on C. M. 66 sollicitam habere. In such phrases we
have the first step towards the conversion of habere into'an auxiliary
verb, which is completed in the Romance languages. cf. also 97 ex-
ploratum habeas. See Brachet, Historical French Grammar, Bk. 2,
Part 2. — ut: ‘on condition that ’, ‘so as neither to... ' cf. Aris·
totle Eth. Nic. 9, 9, 3 οὐθεὶς γὰρ ἕλοιτ’ ἂν καθ’ αὑτὸν τὰ πάντ’ ἔχειν
ἀγαθό- Cicero’s words are so near to Aristotle’s as almost to look
like a translation. Nagelsbach §96- 2 points out that Cic. here is
trying to represent μήτε φιλῶν μήτε φιλούμενος, and gives some in·
structive remarks on the modes in Latin of replacing the present par-
ticiple passive. — circumfluere: Verr. 3, 9 istum rebus omnibus
undique ereptis eludentem circumfluere atque abundare. nulla fides:
cf. Ennius», quoted in Off. 1, 26, Nulla sancta societas nee fides regni ;
Luc. Phar. 1, 92 Nulla fides reg-ni socias,- Bacon, Essay on Friendship‚
⁸ Princes .. . cannot gather this fruit ' (of friendship). —- benevolen-
tiae . . . fiducia: in the best prose writers fides and fiducia nearly always
take the objective genitive (⁴trust in ’); the dative, however, is found
in the poets, as Verg. Aen. 3, 69 fides pelago ; ib. ro, 152 fiducia rebus.>
Even with the phrases fidem facere, fiduciam facere, the construction
in good prose is generally alie-uim rei, not alicui rei.

53. quis enim etex cf. Off. 1, 97 si Aeacus aut Minos dicent ‘ode-

 

rint dum metuant’3 Phil. 1, 34 in sabulis ipsi illi qui ‘oderint dum me-
tuant’ dixerit. — dumtaxat ad tempus: ‘but only for a season’.
Dumtaxat in the best writers is merely corrective, introducing an ex-
ception upon some word or words preceding, here on coluntur. Taxat
is probably a subjunctive of the lost Latin aorist (here the weak
aorist) from tangere a form of tongere (denken, think). Oscan formS,
tangr‘no·m, tang-inoff = scitum, scito (or iussu or decreto) are preserved.
The formation of taxat will be then practically the same as that of
λέξῃ. For the dropping of the nasal cf. σφίγγω, ἔσφιεας θιγγάνω, θίξιν.
The original meaning of dumtaxat would thus be ‘ provided one knows
the matter ’. The verb taxare is used only in late Latin. — ad tem-
