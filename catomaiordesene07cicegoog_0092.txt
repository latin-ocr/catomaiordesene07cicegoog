56 NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. [n

he conquered the Corsicans and Sardinians. In 228 he was again
consul, and died as augur in 212. He is said, but erroneously, to have
been the first Roman who divorced his wife. In 216, just after the
battle of Cannae, he made a most remarkable proposal, to fill up the
gaps which that battle had made in the numbers of the senate by
selecting two members from each of the Latin communities. It was
almost the only occasion in the course of Roman history when any-
thing like modern representative government was advocated. Car·
vilius was not sprung from one of the noble families, who for the
most part monopolized the higher offices of state3 it is therefore not
surprising that he should have sympathized with Flaminius. -—-
contra senatus auctoritatem: ‘against the expressed wish of the
senate '. Senatus auctoritas is, strictly speaking, an opinion of the
senate not formally embodied in a decree, senatus consultum. Cicer0,
in Invent. 2, 52 says Flaminius carried his law contra voluntatem
omnium optimatium. ——- dividenti: ‘when he tried to divide ’. The
participle is here equivalent to cum with the imperfect indicative (divi-
debat). So in 54 lenientem. A. 290, ας G. 6683 H. 549, 1.

really that the auspisia were a political instrument in the hands of
the aristocrats, rather than a partos religion. F abiuS, according to
Liv. 30, 26, 7, was augur for 62 years before his death, and had no
doubt had a large experience in the manipulation of the auspicia for
political purposes. Compare Homer, Iliad, 12, 2433 also Cic. Phil.

12. admirabilius: ‘more amazing'. The Latin word has a much
stronger meaning than the English word derived from it. quo
modo tulit: =eum modum quo tulit, so that the clause is not really

dependent on cognovi, nor tulit irregularly put for tulerit. In Lael. 9
Laelius exclaimS, of Cato himself, quo modo, ut alia omittam, mortem
fili tulit. And no doubt Cic. meant here to make Cato allude to his
loSS, described in 84. — fili: see n. on 1 praemi. consularis:
the son of Fabius was consul in 213 with Ti. Sempronius Gracchus.
—-— est in manibus: ‘is in every one’s hands ’, ‘is commonly read ’.
The expression is common enough in this sense; e. g. Lael. 96 in
manibus est oratio. laudatio: sc. funebris, the funeral speech.
This composition was read in Cicero's time (see Tusc. 3, 70 ; Fam. 4
