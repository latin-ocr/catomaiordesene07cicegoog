Ι] NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. 39

great victory of Cynoscephalae over the Macedonians, which ended
the war. At the Isthmian games in the spring of 196 Flamininus made
his famous proclamation of freedom to all the Greeks. He returned
to Rome in 194 to enjoy a splendid triumph. For the rest of his life
he was employed chiefly on diplomatic business concerning Greece
and the East. One of his embassies was to Prusias, king of Bithynia,
to call on him to surrender Hannibal, who was living at his court in
advanced old age; this led to Hannibal's suicide. Flamininus was
censor in 189 (see below, 42), and lived on till some time after 167, in
which year he became augur; but the date of his death is unknown.
He was a man of brilliant ability both as general and as diplomat, and
also possessed much culture and was a great admirer of Greek litera-
ture.-—ille vir etc.= i. e. the shepherd mentioned in n. on line 1.
Livy 32, 11, 4 says that Flamininus sent to the master of the shepherd,
CharopuS, an Epirote prince, to ask how far he might be trusted.
Charopus replied that Flamininus might trust him, but had better keep
a close watch on the operations himself. —haud magna cum re:
‘ of no great property’ 3 ra== refhmiliari‚ as is often the case elsewhere
in both verse and prose. Ct'. pro Caelio 78 hominem sine re. Cum

magna re would have had just the same meaning. Madvig, Gram.
§258 has similar examples. —plenusz final s was so lightly pro-
nounced that the older poets felt justified in neglecting it in their
scanning. It was probably scarcely pronounced at all by the less
educated Romans, since it is ot'ten wholly omitted in inscriptions, and
has been lost in modern Italian. Cicero, Orator 161, says that the
neglect to pronounce final s is ‘somewhat boorish ’ (submticum),
though formerly thought ‘very refined ' (politius). Even Lucretius
sometimes disregards it in his scanning. In the ordinary literary
Latin a large number of words has lost an original ες e. g. all the
nouns of the -a declension. A. 375, a; G. 7223 H. 608, 1, n. 3. —
fidei: this form of the genitive of fides is found also in PlautuS‚ Aulu-
laria 57 5, and Lucretius 5, 102. Falli as genitive seems only to occur
in late poets, but as dative it is found in a fragment of Ennius. Fid?
as genitive occurs in Horace and Ovid. H. 585, 111. 13 Roby, 357, (c).

—quamquamt see n. on 2 etsi. -- sollicitari etc.= Cicero prob-
ably has not quoted the line as Ennius wrote it. The word sic, at least,

is evidently inserted on purpose to correspond with ut before Flami·
