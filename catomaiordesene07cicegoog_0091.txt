ιι] NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. 55

mander who held the citadel of Tarentum while Hannibal was in
possession of the town. Cicero probably found the commander de·
scribed by the annalists merely as M. Livius (so in Livy 24, 2ο, 133
26, 39, 1), and then jumped to the conclusion that he was the famous
M. Livius Salinator. This man, the father of the Salinator men-
tioned in 7, was consul in ²19 and subdued the Illyrians, but was
condemned for misappropriation of public moneys and went into
exile. In 210 he was induced to return by the desire of the sen-
ate. In 207 he became consul with C. Claudius Nero, and defeated
Hasdrubal in the great battle of the Metaurus. In 204 Livius was
censor with Nero as his colleague, and won his name Salinator by
imposing a tax on salt. The title was bestowed in ridicule, but clung
to the family. Salinator was a relative of Μ. Livius MacatuS. See
Liv. 27, 34, 7. — ita dicenti etc.= the anecdote is told by Livy, 27,
25, 5 and Plutarch, Fab. 23. Both, however, refer the story not to
the time at which Tarentum was taken, but to the year after, when
altercations about it took place in the senate. — toga: here put
for ‘ civil life’, the toga being replaced in time of war by the sag-um.
Cf. in Pisonem 73 pacis est insigne et oti toga, contra autem arma .
tumultus atque belli; De Or. 3, 167 ‘togam ’, pro ‘pace ’, ‘arma ⁹, ac
‘tela ', pro ‘bello'. We have the same contrast between arma and
toga in Cicero’s own much-derided verse, cedant arma togae, concedat
laurea laudi, which is defended by him, in Pis. 73 and Off. 1, 77. —·
consul iterum etc.: as the second consulship of Fabius was in 228
Β. c., while the law of Flaminius was passed in 232 (according to
Polybius), it is very difficult to understand the statement here made.
It is possible that Flaminius was one of the commissioners for exe-
cuting his own law, and that its execution lasted over the time of
Fabius’ second consulship. The Flaminius here mentioned is the
same who fell as consul in 217 at the battle of lake Trasimenus. He
held large and statesman·like views on the policy of secut-ing Italy by
planting Romans and Latins in the territory then recently taken from
the Gauls‚ in, the neighborhood of Ariminum. This particular meas·
ure was carried against the will of the senate, and was the first law
passed, since the lex Hortensia of 287, in defiance of its wishes. It
was also the first agrarian law since the Licinio-Sextian law of 367.
Polybius dates the decline of the Roman constitution from the pass-
ing of the lex Flaminia. Cf. ‘ Rheinisches Museum ', 1843, p. 573. —-
