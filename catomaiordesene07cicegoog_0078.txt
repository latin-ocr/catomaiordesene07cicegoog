42 NOTEs To CATO MAloR ’ {2

and me of the burden ’ says “1 wish yourself and me to be relieved ’.
— etsi: = καίτοι ‘and yet ’. This use of etsi to introduce a clause
correcting the preceding clause, though not uncommon (e. g. below
293 Tusc. 1, 993 3, 173 4, 633 5, 55), is far less common than that of
quamquam, which we have in 1, 9, ιο, 24, 47, 67, 69. ——te quidem:
‘ you at all events '‚ ‘you for one ’. —·- modice ac sapienter: modice
recalls moderationem above (modice and moderate are used with exactly
the same sense by Cic.), while sapienter recalls aequitatem, since sapi-
entia produces stability and an even balance of the mind. In De Or.
1, 132 we have modice et scienter. sicut omnia: cf. Fin. 1, 7 fa·
cete is quidem siem alia ,· also below, 65 ,πὶ-ιιι alia. —·- et ferre et
laturum esse: Tischer rightly remarks that when a verb is repeated
thus with a variation of tense Cic. very nearly always uses et. . . et, and
not a single et merely. The contrast between the two tenses is thus
made more pointed. Cf. 3 et diximus et dicemus. certo scio:
one of the best MSS„ followed by some editorS, has here certeseia.
The latter phrase would mean ‘ 1 am sure that I know ’ (a sense which
seems out of place here); the former ‘I have certain or sure knowl-
edge'. Observe that certe may be used with all verbs, while certo is
only used with scire. A. 151, c. sed: the idea implied is, ‘but
though 1 well know you do not need such consolation, 1 have yet
resolved to address my book to you ’. — occurrebas dignus: a con-
densed construction for occurrebat te dignum esse.

P. 2. — munere . . . uteretur: ‘ a gift such as we both might make
use of in company ’. — mihi quidem: this forms a correction
upon uterque nostrum above: ‘whatever you may think of the work,
I at least have found the writing of it pleasant '. —- confectio:
‘composition ’ ; ‘ completion ’ς a word scarcely found in the clas·
sical Latin except in' Cicero’s writingS. Cf. De Or. 2, 52 anna-
lium confectio ,· pro. Font. 3 confectio tabularum (⁴ account-books ³).
-— fuit ut absterserit: the sequence of tenses fuit ut abstergeret
would have been equally admissible, but the meaning would have been
slightly different. With the perfect the sense is ‘was so pleasant that
it‘ has wiped away’; with the imperfect ‘was so pleasant that it did
,‘ while 1 was writing) wipe away '. The metaphor in absterserit is com-
mon: e. g. Tusc. 3, 43 luctum omnem absterseris. With this statement
of Cicero's concerning the effect the work had on himself contrast Att.
14, 21, 3 legendus mihi saepius est Cato maior ad te minus. A m ari a·
rem enim me senectus-facit. Stomachor onmia—omnis: aeq
