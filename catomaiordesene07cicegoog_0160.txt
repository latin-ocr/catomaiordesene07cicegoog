iv INTRODUCTION.

Greek and Roman men of letters, Hellenism had been power-
ful for several generations in Latin literature and social lise. In
the Hellenism of the Scipionic circle, however, not only were
old tendencies quickened, but a new and important influence
was added, that of the Greek philosophy. Although the wis·
dom of the Greeks was known in part to the Romans at a much
earlier time, its practical power over them dates from the famous
Athenian embassy of 155 B. c. composed of the three great phi-
losophers, Carneades the Academic, Diogenes the Stoic, and
⁷ Critolaus the Peripatetic. After this time all the Greek systems
struck root at Rome, but by far the greatest influence was ex·
erted by Stoicism, of which nearly all the members of Scipio's
society had a tincture more or less strong. Thus Scipio himself
was devoted to the society of the Stoic philosopher Panaetius ;
Laelius had learned Stoicism from both Panaetius and Diogenes.
There are many tinges of Stoicism traceable in our dialogue.
These noble Romans, however, adopted the Stoic philosophy
more on account of its utility in supplying a foundation for
theories of law and government than as a form of saith. The
Stoicism they professed was also a Stoicism deprived of its
paradoxes and specially adapted to Roman tasteS. In this
form it ultimately exercised a profound influence on the na-
tional life of Rome.

Though the prevalent bent of the Scipionic circle was towards
Stoicism, it was far from rejecting the society of those who
adhered to other systems. Thus ClitomachuS, the New Aca·
demic‚ was the friend of many Romans of high station in his time.

On the literary side the circle of Scipio and Laelius was strong.

To it belonged Polybius, the great historian, Lucilius the satirist,
and the dramatists Terence and Pacuvius, with many others
scarcely less distinguished. We cannot here give any detailed
account of the persons who formed this brilliant society, but
must confine ourselves to such information as is necessary to
illustrate the LaeliuS.
