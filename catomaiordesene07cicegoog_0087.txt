8] NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. 51

multorum, and of multorum from senectutem. — sine querella: at·
tribute ot senectutem. A. 217, Rem.; H. 359, n. 1, 4), and n. 3„ This
form of attributive phrase, consisting of a preposition with a noun, is
common3 cs. 24 ex agro Sabino rusticos Romanos ‚· 40 cum hostibus clan-
> destina colloquia. Querella is better spelling than querela. See Roby,
177, 2.—qui3 ‘men of such nature as to...’—et...nec:
Roby, 2241. The reason for the departure from the ordinary sequence
of particles lies in the words non moleste. Nec. ..et is common3 see
51, 53. ——libidinum vinculis etc-z Cic. is here thinking of tho
conversation between Socrates and Cephalus in Plato, Rep- 329 D, for
which see Introd. — moderati: ‘ seli-controlled ’ς cf. n. on 1 mode-
rationem ,· dffciles, ⁶ peevish ’ς inhumani, ‘ unkindly ’ς importunitas,
⁸ perversity’. Importunitas seems to be used as the substantive cor
responding in sense with the adjective dffcilis. Difficultas, in the
sense of ‘ peevishness ', probably occurs only in Mur. ¹9·

8. dixerit quispiam: ‘some one will say presently’3 a gentle way
of introducing one's own obiection. The mood of dixerit is probably
indicative, not subjunctive; see the thorough discussion in Roby,
Gram., Vol. 2, Pref., p. c1v. et seq. opes et copias: ‘resources
and means ’. Opes has a wider meaning than copias (mere material
wealth) and includes all sources of power, influence, and authority as
well as wealth. Thus in Lael. 22 the end of divitiae is said to be en·
ioymentg of opes, worship (opes ut colare). Dagnitas is social position,
— id: remark the singular pronoun, which indicates that the pre·
ceding clause is now taken as conveying one idea. Trans. ‘ such for·
tune '. -- contingere ε ‘to tall to one’s lot ' is the phrase in English
which most closely represents contingere. This verb is not. as is often
assumed, used merely of good fortune ; it implies in itsels nothing con·

 

cerning the character of events, whether they be good or bad, but .

simply that the events take place naturally and were to be expected.
See n. on Lael. 8, where the word is distinctly used in connection with
bad fortune, as it is, strikingly, in 71 below. —- est . . . omnia: ‘your
statement indeed amounts to something, but it by no means comprises
every consideration ’. 'The phrase esse aliquid, ‘ to be of some impor-
tance ’, is often used by Cic. both ot' things and of persons; cf. Tusc.
5, 104 eos aliquid esse, also h. on 17 nihil afferunt. So esse aliquis of
personS, as inv the well-known passage of Iuvenal, 1, 72 aude aliquid
brevibus Gyaris et carcere dtgnum si vis esse aliquis. For the general
sense cf. Tusc. 3, 52 est id quidem magnum, sed non sunt in hoc-omnim
