”1 14 NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. [77

canus in Spain and afterwards served with honor in Africa. He was
an intimate friend of Cato. See Liv. 26, 42 etseq. —- tuque : so in
Lael. 100 C. Fanni et tu, Q. Μυός but above, 4 and 9 simply Scipio
etLaeli. — quae est sola vita: ct. n. on mitam nullam in 7. —
nam dum sumus etc.: the whole of this doctrine is Platonic3 cf.
Lael. 13. -- munere necessitatis et . . . opere: ‘function and task
allotted us by fate ’.

P. 82. — immortalis: Cicero rarely mentions the gods without
this epithet. -- sparsisset Horace calls the soul divinae parti cu·
la m aurae. -—- tuerentur: rule, or guard, or care for. Most editors
wrongly take tuerentur to be for intuerentur, ‘ to look upon ', and re· ’
gard it as an intentional archaism. But cf. Rep. 6, 15 (where no
archaism can be intended): homines sunt hac lege generati, qui taceren-
tur illum globum quae terra vocatur ‚· also tuentw' below in 82. —--—
contemplantes imitarentur: perhaps more Stoic than Platonic; the
Stoics laid great stress on the ethical value of a contemplation and
imitation of the order of the universe. Cf. N. D. 2, 37 :pse homo ortus
est ad mundum contemplandum et imitandum ,· Sen. Dial. 8, 5. 1 Na-
tura nos ad ulnamque genuit, et contemplationi rerum et actiani. --
modo: here modus seems to be the Platonic τὸ μέτριον, or perhaps a
reminiscence of the Aristotelian doctrine of the mean (n. on 46).
Translate ‘in moderatiori and consistency of life’3 and cf. Off. 1, 93
rerum modus ‘moderation in all things ’. For constantia see n. on 4.
-— ita: cf. n. on 16 et tamen sic.

78. Pythagoran: see n. to ²3· No ancient philosopher held more
firmly than Pythagoras to belief in the immortality of the soul3 it
formed a part of his doctrine of MetempsychosiS. He was also noted
t'or bis numerical speculatione in Astronomy and Music. With
him is said to have originated the doctrine of the ‘harmony of the
spheres'. — qui essent: ‘inasmuch as they were '. Cicero often
tries to make out a connection between Pythagoras and the early Ro-
mans; cf. Tusc. 4, 23 also Liv. 1, 18. -- ex universa mente: the
world-soul. Diog. Laert. 8 gives as Pythagor-ean the doctrine ψυχὴν
εἶναι ἀπόσπασμα τοῦ αἰθέρος καὶ ἀθάνατον. Similar doctrines occur in
Plato and the Stoics; cf. Div. 1, 110 a qua (i. e. a namra deorum) ut
doctissimis· sapientissimisque placuit, haustos animos et libatos habemus;
Tusc. 5, 38 humanus animus decerptus ex mente devina ‚⁶ Sen. Dial. 12,
6, 7. — haberemus: imperfect where the English requires the
present. A. 287, ἅς Η. 495, V. — Socrates: in Plato’s J’haedo.
