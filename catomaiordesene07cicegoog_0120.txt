84 NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. [36-

H. 450, 1. ιι. and foot-note 4. —deliratiot ‘dotage’; a rare word,
used by Cic. only here and in Div. 2, 90.

3⁷. robustos: ‘sturdy ’ς implying that the sons were grown up.
—— tantam: sc. quantam habuit; only a little more emphatic than
magnam would have been3 see n. on 52. — Appius: see n. on 16.
— regebat: the paterfamilias in early Roman times was an almost
irresponsible ruler over his children and household. For a full dis-
cussion of the patria potestas see CoulangeS, Ancient City, Bk. 11.
Ch. 83 Maine, Ancient Law, Ch. 5; Hadley, Introd. to Roman Law,
Chapters 5 and 6. — et . . . senex: ‘ though both blind and old '. —
intentum : commonly used of animus, like the opposite remis-sus (28).
— tenebat etc.: the patria potestas is often denoted by the word im-
perium ,· cf: De Invent. 2, 140 imperium domesticum. —— vigebat
etc.= ‘ in him ancestral spirit and principles were strong ’. While ani-
mus patrius here evidently means the strong will for which the patri·
cian Claudii were proverbial (as e. g. in Rosc. Am. 46 intellegere qui
animus patrius sit in liberos) it indicates the feeling of a particular
father for his children. ,

Ρ. 16. — 38. ita τ = ea lege ‘ on these conditionS, viz. . . .’, the clause
with si being an explanation of ita. This correspondence of ita . . . si
is common in Cicero; see n. on 12 ita . . . quasi. Here translate ‘age
can only be in honor 'if it fights for itself ’. — se ipsa: cf. Cic.
Acad. 2, 36 veritas se ipsa desendet; see also the n. on 4. — si. ..
est ι ‘ if it has passed into bondage to nobody ’. Manctpium is a piece
of property3 emancipare is to pass a piece of property out of its own·
er’s hands. The word acquired two exactly opposite meaningS. When
used of a slave, or of a son in patria potestate, who was legally subject
to many of the same ordinances as a slave, it means ‘to set free ³, un·
less, as in Fin. 1, 24 filium in adoptionem D. Silano mancipaverat,
some person is mentioned to whom the original owner makes over his
rightS. But in Plaut. Bacchid. 1, 1, 90 mulier, tibi me emancupo the
sense is ‘ 1 enslave myself to you ’, i. e. ‘ 1 pass myself out of my own
power into yours’. So in the well-known passage of Horace, Epod.
9, 12 (of Antony) emancipatus feminae ‘enslaved to a woman'g cf.
Cic. Phil. 2, 51 venditum atque emancipatum tribunatum. senile
aliquid... aliquid adulescentis: chiasmus. For the sense cf. 33
ferocitas iuvenum . . . senectutis maturitas. -- quod qui sequitur:
‘ and he who strives after this '‚ i. e. to combine the virtues of age and
youth. Cf. Aesch- Sept. 622 γέροντα τὸν νοῦν σάρκα δ’ ἡβῶσαν φύει
