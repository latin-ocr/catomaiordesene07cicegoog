Maior, 16 non dubitavit dicere. sapientem: see Introd. p. vii.
— ita eram deductus etc.= ‘ had been introduced to Scaevola
with this design, that etc! For this sense of deducere, to introduce a
young man to a master or guardian, cf. Cael. 9 ut kuic virilem togam
dedit. . . hunc a patre continuo ad me esse deductum. It was a common
practice to attach youths for a time to the society of distinguished ju·
rists or orators3 see Tac. Dial. 343 Quint. 12, 11, 6. — Scaevolam .
but above (line 1) Q. Mucius, in both cases the same person; Lah-

Nep. Hamilc. r, 3 and 5. — virili toga: called also toga pura (as

 

in Att. 7, 8, 5) to distinguish it from the toga praetexta, sometimes -

called merely praeteita, the purple-bordered robe worn at ⁵Rome by
magistrates and children. The toga of the ordinary adult citizen was
not dyed. The toga vin‘lek was generally assumed at the beginning of

disputare in the active to govern an accusative of a neuter pronoun,
in place of the usual constr., de with abl. In his use ot the passive
he is more free3 thus he says in De Or. 1, 22 re quaesita et dtkputata,

-— prudentia: this word usually implies not wisdom in general but
skill in some special subject 3 here Roman Law3 cf. prudens in iure

Maximus, was a relative of Scaevola the Augur. He was a man of
exalted character and great abilities both as a jurist and as an orator.
He is said to have been the first Roman who wrote a systematic trea-
tise on the Civil Law, and his work on that subject, in eighteen books,
had great influence on succeeding jurists. He was consul in 95 Β. e.,
and having been proscribed by the party of Marius lost his life in a
riot, Β. c. 82. -- rne . . . contuli ε contrast this with a patre deductus
eram above. -ἒ- unum . . . praestantissimum : this emphatic use of
unus with the superlative is common in Cic„ e. g. Tusc. 2, 643 4, 553
