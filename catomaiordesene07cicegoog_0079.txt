3] No‘rsss To caro MAloa. 43

pl. A. 55, e3 G. 60, ις Η. 67.-—efl'ecerit mollem: so 56 poteratne
tantm animus efficere non iucundam senectutenu but 56 conditiora
facit haec aucupium. Efficio gives more emphatically thansacio the
idea of the completion oi the action. Cf. Lael- 73 efficere aliquem
consulem, ‘to carry through a man’s election as consul '; facere aliquem
consulem being merely ‘to vote for a man’s election to the consulship ’.
satis digne: ‘ as she desei-ves '‚ lit. ‘in a sufficiently worthy man·
ner ’. Some editors have thought dig-ne superfluous and wished to cast
it out, but we have satis· digne elsewhere, as in Verr. Act. 11. 1, 823 cf.
also Sex. Rosc. 33 pro dignitate laudare satis commode. — qui pa-
reat . ..degere x a conditional sentence of irregular form (qui = siquis ,-
cui, simply connective, = et ei). Cf. Div. 1, 127 qui enim teneat causas
rerum staturarum, idem necesse est omnia teneat quae littura sint ,· also
the examples in Roby’s Grammar, 1558. A. 310, a, 307, b; G. 594, 1,
5983 H. 507, ΙΙ. and ΙΙΙ. 2. Some, however, make possit a subjunc-
tive of characteristic or of cause with rui, and pareat 3 subjunctive by
attraction.-—omne tempus aetatis: ‘every season of life ’; so in
55 extremum tempus aetatis ‚· 70 breve tempus aetatis. The opposite
phrase aetas temporis is very rare; it occurs in Propertius 1, 4, 7.

3. ceteris: neuter adjective used as a noun, equivalent to ceteris
rebus ‘the other matters '; i. e. the political troubles hinted at above.
The best writers do not osten use the neuter adjective as noun in the
oblique cases unless there is something in the context to show the
gender clearly, as in 24 aliis...eis quae; we have, however, below
in 8, isto = ista re ,· 72, reliquum ,· 77, caelestium = rerum caeles·
tium ,· and in 78, praeteritorum ficturorumque ‚· see other instances in
n. on Lael. 5ο similium. The proleptic or anticipatory use of ceteris
should also be noticed; its sense is not fully seen till we come to
hunc librum ,· the same use occurs below in 4, 5, 59, 60; so alies in
243 cf. also n. on Lael. 7 reliqua. -- diximus . . . dicemus: when a
clause or phrase consists of four parts, which go in pairs (as here
diximus, dicemus on one side, and multa, saepe on the other), the
Latins frequently arrange the words so as to put one pair between
the two 'members of the other pair, as here. This usage is called by
grammarians chiasmus. Thus if we denote· the four parts by AA',
BB', chiasmus requires the order A BB'A ' or BAA'B'. See examples
in 8, ⁸20, 22, 38, 44, 71. For the more complicated forms of chiasmus
consult N'agelsbach, Stil. ἐς 167, 169. A. 344, f ; G. 6843 H. 562. —
librum .. . misimus: observe the omission of a particle at the begin·
