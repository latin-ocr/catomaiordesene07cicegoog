82 NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. [34-

34. audire te arbitror: ‘1 think that news reaches you ⁹. —--
hospes τ see n. on 28 orator. — avitus ε there was a strong friend-
ship between the elder Africanus and Masinissa, king of Numidia,
who in 206 Β. c. passed over from the Carthaginian alliance to that
of the Romans. He was richly rewarded by Scipi0, and remained
loyal to Rome till his death. He lived to welcome the younger Scipio
in Africa during the last Punic war, and to see the utter ruin of Cair—
thage. See Sall. Iug. 5, 4. For the expression hospes tuus avitus cf.
Plautus, Miles 135 paternum suom hospitem. cum ingressus
etc.= i. e. protracted exercise of one kind did not weary him.
cum . . . equo ε though Cic. says in equo vehi, esse, sedere etc. the prep-
osition here is left out because a mere ablative of manner or means
is required to suit the similar ablative pedibus. So Div. 2, 140 equus
in quo vehebar, ‘the horse on which Ι rode ’ς but ib. 1, 58 equo advectus
ad ripam, ‘ brought to the b‘ank by the aid of a horse ’. siccitatem ι
‘wiriness ’, literally ‘ dryness ' or {reedom from excessive perspiration,
colds and the like; cf. Tusc. 5, 99 stkcitatem quae consequitur continen-
tiam in victu ,· Catull. 23, 12 corpora sicciora cornu. regis: here
= reg-ia. officia et munera: see n. on 29. — ne sint: ‘grant
that age has no strength '. This formula of concession for argument’s
sake is frequent in Cicer0, who often attaches to it sane. A. 266, dg
G. 6103 H. 515, 111. -ss— senectute =senibus: see n. on 26. —
legibus et institutis: ‘by statute and precedent ’. — muneribus
eis etc.: chiefly military service. — non modo . . . sed ne quidem ε
when a negative follows non modo these words have the force of non
modo non, a negative being borrowed from the negative in the subse-
quent clause. But often non modo non is written3 the negative after

 

 

 

 

 

modo is then more emphatic, being independent. Here non modo non
quod ‘non would have had a harsh sound. A. 149, ες G. 484, 3 and
Rem. 1.; H. 552, 2. quod: adv. acc. (see n. on 1 quid). cf.
Liv. 6, 15 sed vos id cogenda estis.

form as that in which the objection is urged, at id quidem etc. So

P· 15. - commune valetudinisz ‘common to weak health ⁹, i. e.
to all in a weak state of health. Valeludo means in itselfneither good
nor bad health; the word takes its coloring from the context. ——
filius is qui: a pause must be made at filius ,· the sense is not ‘that
son of Africanus who adopted you ', but ‘the son of Africanus, I mean
