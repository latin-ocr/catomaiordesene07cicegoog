(ι ) Laelius. The chief speaker is Gaius Laelius, the friend
of the younger Africanus.² Laelius, distinguished asstatesmam
soldier, and man of letterS, was born about 186 B.c. He was
plebeian tribune in 151, performed heroic exploits as an officer of
Scipio in the Third Punic War, was praetor in 145,⁸ and com-
manded an army against Viriathus with success. He presented
himself as candidate for the consulship in 141, but though sup·
ported by Scipio⁴ he failed of election3 the next year, however,
he succeeded. He also held the office of augur.⁵ During the
greater part of his life he was a strong supportet· of the aristo·
cratic party. In his later days he sternly opposed the schemes
of Ti. Gracchus ⁶

Laelius was not only one of the greatest patrous of literature
Rome ever saW, but was himself a man of high culture and great
ability as a speaker and writer. He was widely read in philos-
ophy, particularly the Stoic. His Latin style was so good that
the plays of his friend Terence, admired for the purity of their
Latinity‚ were by many ascribed. in whole or in part to him.⁷
Some of his speeches were extant in Cicero’s time, and were,
on the whole, admired by him.⁸

Cicero everywhere speaks in the most eulogistic terms of
Laelius' character. All authorities were unanimous as to his
unswerving rectitude.⁹ His sels-control and moderation were
remarkable.¹⁰ Like SocrateS, throughout life he never showed in
his face the effect produced on his mind by changes of fortune.1¹
