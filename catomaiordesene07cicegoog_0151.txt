’ 18] NOTES To CATO MAIOR. 115

⁴ —immortalitate animorum: this is commoner than immortalitas

animi, for ‘the immortality ot the soul ’ς so Lael. 143 Tusc. 1, 80
aeternitas anchorum. — dissensisset: subjunctive because involv·
ing the statements of some other person than the speaker. A. 341, c;
G. 6303 H. 528, 1. —is qui esset etc.z ‘a man great enough to
have been declared wisest ’. See n. on Lael. 7 Apollinis.. . iusta-atum.
—- sict cf. ita above. -—- celeritas animorum: the ancients pic-
tured to themselves the mind as a substance capable of exceedingly
rapid movement3 cf. Tusc. 1, 43 nulla cst celeritas quae possit cum an·
imi celeritate contendere. — tantae scientiae ε as the plural of scientia
is almost unknown in classical Latin, recent editors take scientiae here
as genitive, ‘so many arts requiring so much knowledge '. In favor
of this interpretation are such passages as Acad. 2, 146 artem sine
scientia esse non posse ; Fin. 5, 26 ut omnes artes in aliqua scientia ver-
sentur. Yet in De Or. 1, 61 physica ista et mathematica et quae paulo
ante ceterarum artium propria posuisti, scientiae sunt eorum qui illa pro-
fitentur it is very awkward to take scientiae as genitive. — cumque
semper etc.= this argument is copied very closely from Plato’s Phae-
drus, 24 5 c, — principium motus: ἀρχὴ κινήσεως in Plato. — se
ipse: cf. n. on 4 a se ipsi. — cum simplex etot from Plato’s
Phaedo, 78-80. The general drift of the argument is thisz material
things decay because they are compounded of parts that tall asunderg
there is nothing to show that the soul is so compounded; therefore no
reason to believe that it will so decay. Notice the imperfects esset...
haberet. ..posset accommodated to the tense of persuasi above, although
the other subjunctives in the sentence are not3 cf. n. on 42 efficeret.
—- neque...dissimile: in modern phraseology the whole of this
clause would be briefly expressed thus,—‘ and was homogeneous ⁹.
—— posset: quodsi =‘whereas if ’, the subject of posset being ani·
mus, and dividi being understood. — magno argumento: ἱκανὸν
τεκμήριον in Pl. Phaed. 72 Α. Belief in the immortality of the soul
naturally follows the acceptance of the doctrine of pre-existence.
homines scire etc.= See Plato, Phaedo, 72 2-73 n. The notion that
the souls of men existed before the bodies with which they are con·
nected has been held in all ages and has often found expression in
literature. The English poets have not infrequently alluded to it.
See Wordsworth's Ode on the Intimations of Immortality from the
Recollections of Early Childhood, ⁴ Our birth is but a sleep and a ⁷
iorgetting’ etc.; also, in Tennyson’s Two Voices the passage begin·
