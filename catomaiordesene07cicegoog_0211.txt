Homer, 11. 12, 243 εἷς οἰωνὸς ἄριστος. For the gen. nostrae civitate}
cf. Tusc. 3, 81 unum omnium maximum. The strengthening force
of unus is also seen in the common phrases qm'vir unus, quilibet unus,
unns aliqum unus quisque. See Kennedy, Grani„ 34, vi. A), bg Mad-

used with memini, if the person who recalls an event was a witness
of it, he may either (a) vividly picture to himself the event and its
attendant circumstances so that it becomes really present to his
mind's eye for the moment, in which case he uses the present infin-

latter of these two ways. As regards (a) cf. Verg. Ecl. 9, 52 longos

of the household furniture, but placed outside in the grounds, and
used for conversations or IessonS, the shape enabling the company
to see each other’s faces. So, at the outset of the discussion in the
Academica (1, 14), Cic. says omnes in conspectu consedimus.
admodum ε qualifies pauci, as in Tusc. 4, 6 nulla fere mnt aut pauca
