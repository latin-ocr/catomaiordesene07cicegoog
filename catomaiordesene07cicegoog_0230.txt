62 NOTES TO LAELIUS. [17-

De Or. 1, 1023 ib. 3, 127. — quamvis subitot=tam subito quam
vas— magnum opus est: so in De Or. 1, ¹03 Cicero says οἱ
Gorgias permagnum quidem suscipere ac profiteri emebatur. For mag·-
num opus-:a great task, cf. Academ. 2, 1213 Tusc. 3, 79 and 843
Orat. 75. quae possunt : this refers to Fannius' words above
de amis-itia dtis-putans. There is a contrast between dasputari and
hortari ; Laelius at first declares himself unable to give a scientific
and philosophical discussion of friendship; he can only give some
practical directions concerning it. — censeo petatis: petatis is
directly dependent on cense0, ut being suppressed‚ as it often is with
curo, caveo, sinere, hortari, and many other verbs; cf. n. on 10 cave.
anteponatis etc.: for the sense cf. 104. —-— nihil est enim:
note enim, third word in the clause3 had it stood second est would
not have been so emphatic. tarn naturae aptum: the phrases
naturae aptus, ad naturam aptus are common in Cic. (as Fin. 4, 463
Off. 1, 100) and are of Stoic origin. The Stoics defined virtue as
being τῇ φύσει ὁμολινγυιρμείἰιη·Δ (ἣν, naturae convenienter vivere. Cf.
below 19 naturam optimam bene vivendi ducem. — vel secundas
vel adversas: so Cic. says of literature (Arch. 16) secundas res
ornant, adversis perficgt‘um ac solacium praebent.

18. nisi in bonis: ‘except in the case of good men ’. Cf. 65,
where inter bonos corresponds to in bonis here. — neque . . . reseco:
‘nor do I probe the question to its roots ’, i. e. the question whether
only good men can be friends. The Stoics had declared that only
perfect men (sapientes, σοφοί or σπουδαῖοι =b0ni, since none but the
σοφός is σπουδαῖος) could be friends. So Diog. Laert. 7, 124 τὴν
φιλίαν ἑν μόνοις τοῖς σπουδαίοις εἶναι λέγουσι, and Aristotle Eth. Nic.
8 and 9 passim ,· also Socrates in Xen. Mem. 2, 6, 20. The phrase
ad vivum resecare, literally ‘to cut back to the quick ², is here iden· “
tical in meaning with the subtilius disserere that follows and with the
subtilius quaerere of 7. — sed ad etc.= sc. dissmnt. -— sit ita
sane: this is a common formula aegre concedentis. So Academ. 2, 84
ne sit sane ‚· ib. 2, 105 sint falsa sane. eam . . . interpretantur:
sc. esse (cf. 50, 64); ‘ they understand wisdom to be a thing which . . . ’ς
eam is by attraction for id. A. 195, d: G. 202, Rem. 5; H. 445, 4.
nemo: cf. 7 and 9. The leading Greek Stoic philosophers hardly

 

 

 

 

ever ventured to point out any actual person as having attained to
wisdotn. Posidonius (Dio'g. 7, 94) seems to have allowed that Soc·
rates, DiogeneS, and Antisthenes, had made some advance towards
