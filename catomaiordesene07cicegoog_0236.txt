(ib. 8, 5, 3) and ἀληθὴς φιλία in Plato, Lysis ²14 υς cf. vera amicitia
in 23, 58. — pauci: cf. ¹5· For the use with qui see A. 216, e; G.
368, Rem. 2; H. 397, 2, n. —partiens communicansque: the
two participles differ very little in meaning—no more widely than
‘dividing’ and ‘sharing’ in English. In partiens the notion of mere
division is more prominent, in communicans the notion of comrade-
ship or partnership; cf. 24 in periculis-...communicandis.

P. 10. -23, commoditates: very little different in sense from
opportunitates in 22. Opportunitas expresses rather the idea of ex-
ceptional appropriateness, commoditas rather the characteristic of
usefulness as an ordinary fact. curn . . . contineat — turn . a. prae·
stat: the normal construction with cum tum is for both clauses
to have the same verb, or for the verbs (if different) in both clauses
to be in the same mood and tense. The reason for the variation
here is the desire to point out that the fact contained in the clause
cum...contineat is one which has been already mentioned and dis-
posed of.. ‘ Seeing that friendship furnishes very many and impor-
tant advantages . . . ’. Continet would have been appropriate had the
fact now been mentioned for the first time. cf. Madvig. 358, Obs. 33
A. 326, b; G. 5893 H. 521, 2, 2), n. 1.—illa...omnibus: illa,
abl„ sc. commoditate ‚· cf. 19 ltoc praestat ‚· omnibus = omnibus rebus,
the verbs praestat and praelucet having the same subject, amicitia.
Many editors„ in order to avoid the exceptional omnibus=omnibus

 

rebus, make illa (sc. commoditas) subject to praestat so that omnibus
= o. commoditatibus, while praelucet has for its subject amicitia. The
neuter omnibus used as substantive, though rare, is well attested:
cf. N. D. 2, 363 2, 1333 De Fato 14; Liv. 1, 45; 3, 23.—-spem
praelucet: the verb praelucere is rare even in poetry and very rare
in prose. The transitive use (⁴ holds up the light of hope’) may
perhaps be allowed here, though the only passages quoted for it by
the editors and dictionaries are Auson. Idyll. 4, 95 p. lumen, and
Plaut. Casina 1, 30 p. facem. Plin. Nat. Hist. 32, 141 has praeluceat
baculum, i. e. ‘sets on fire’. — verum amicum: the word verus
is to be taken in a less strict sense than in 22 vera amicitia. —
exemplar' aliquod: Seyffert well quotes here the Magna Moralia 2,
15. Cf. also 80. -- absentes adsunt etc.: intended contradiction
in termS, oxymoron3 cf. Mil. 97 gloriam .· esse hanc unam quae ff·
ceret ut absentes adessemus, mortui viveremus, where edd. quote the
epigram of Simonides on the heroes of Thermopylae -οὐδὲ τεθνᾶσι
