, years of age. The elder son, to whom many of Cato's works were
addressed, died as praetor-elect, before his father ¹. The other
was grandfather of Cato Uticensis. “

The literary activity of the old censor was great, though his
leisure was small.² In Cicero’s time a collection of 150 speeches
was still extant. The titles of about 90 are still known to ηε,
and of some we possess a few fragments. Cato's greatest work,
however, was his Origines, the first real historical work written
in Latin. His predecessors had been merely compilers ’of
chronicles. The work was founded on laborious investigationS,
and comprised the history of Rome from the earliest times per-
haps down to 150 13.c.³, as well as notices of the history of other
important Italian stateS. Further‚ Cato wrote of Agriculture,
to which he was enthusiastically devoted. We still have his
De Re Rustica, a collection of maxims loosely strung together.
He also composed works on law 3 a sort of educational encyclo-
paedia for his son ; and a collection of witty sayings, Ἀποφθέγματα,
drawn from Greek as well as from Roman sources,

Plutarch seems to have known a collected edition of the
pungent and proverbial utterances for which the censor was
famouS, and for which (not for any knowledge of philosophy ⁴)
he received the title of sapiens (‘ shrewd ’) which he bore at the
end of his life. This edition, however, was not compiled by Cato
himself. ’

In view of Cicero’s treatise, the Cato Maior, it is necessary to
say something of Cato’s relations with the Greeks and Greek
literature. The ancients give us merely vague statements that
he only began to learn Greek ⁸ in his old age.’ The expression
must be liberally interpreted if, as seems clear, the whole of his
writings showed the influence of Greek literature. 1t is certain,
however, that he thoroughly detested the Greek nation. This
hatred was shown in acts more than once. No doubt Cato was
