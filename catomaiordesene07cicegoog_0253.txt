45] NOTES TO LAELIUS. 85

ing the death of both these men, as Cic. himself states in Brut. 42 and
43, where he refers to Thuc. 1, 138. In Att. 9, 10, 3 he assumes that
Coriolanus died a natural death. —- nemo: the inference intended
is ‘so much worse are the Romans now than their forefathers, ψ
than the Greeks of Themistocles’ time '.

43. talis: i. e. such as that described in 41.

P. 18.—supplicio: a stronger word than poena above, 4²3 in its
strict sense supplicium means ‘ summary execution ’. For supplicio
mn1'= summo cf. pro Imp. Cn. Pomp. 11. — concessum: sc. esse.
—-- haud scio an: see n. on 20. —- curae: n. on 15 cordi.

44. haec. . dacianus: these words almost exactly repeat the first
sentence of 40. N otice that the clauses are put side by side without
connecting particles. — rogemur: A. 328; G. 5743 H. 519, 11. 2.
— libere: = μετὰ παρρησίας, ‘with all freedom of speech '.
aperte: ‘frankly ’. Cf. 91 monere et moneri etc. -— adhibitae: sc.
auctoritati.

45. narn: ‘1 say this, for’; slightly ellipticg see n. on 41· —-
quos audio etc.: cf. n. on 24 doctum quendam, and for audio n. on 41
γ audierat. Observe that Cic. writes habitos, not haberi. —— placu-
isse: ‘some...have held as dogmas’3 the word placere has often a
much stronger sense than our ‘please '. — mirabilia: παράδοξα, a
word which Cic. translated sometimes by mirabilia (Acad. 2, 136),
sometimes by admirabilia (Parad. prooem. 45 Fin. 4, 74), sometimes
by admiranda. — sed: in contrast to mirabilia— ‘paradoxes in·
deed‚ but ’. — partim: there is slight anacoluthon here; the sen-
tence is closed without the second partim which should correspond to
this, and its place is taken by alios at the beginning of the next sen-
tence. Both partim and alii refer to quibusdam. Such anacolutha,
where only one of a pair of words such as alter— alter, alius—alius etc.
is expressed and the other replaced, in another sentence, by some
other expression, are very common in Cic. Madvig has collected a
large number of examples in the first excursus to his De Finibus, —
fugiendas etc.: Cic. is here evidently imitating a chorus of the Hip·
polytus of EuripideS, 2 53 et seq. The sentiment is the same as that
in Sophocles’ Ajax 680 et seq. nimias: ‘too strong ’, ‘too close ’.
sibi: for the almost pleonastic use cf. Tusc. 5, 42 omnia sibi in
se posita censebit, and the use in comedy of suus sibi. -— laxissimas
habenas: a paraphrase of l. 256 of the passage ref. to above, εὔλυτα
δ’ εἶναι στέργηθρα φρενῶν. The collocation habenas habere seems in-
