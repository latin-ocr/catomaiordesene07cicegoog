ιγ] NOTEs To CATO ΜΑιοκ 65

853 Att. 7, 3, 103 Lucretius 5, 1177. In Munro’s note on the last
passage a collection of examples will be found. — Appi. . . oratio:
the speech was known to Cicero, and was one ot the oldest monu-
ments of prose composition in Latin extant in his time ; see Brut. 61.
Plutarch, Pyrrhus 19, gives an account ot Appius’ speech, which may
be founded on the origina13 he mentions it also in his tract commonly
called ‘an seni sit gerenda res publica ’, c. 21. Ihne (History of Rome,
Vol. Ι. p. 521, Eng. ed.) doubts whether the speech, as Cic. knew it,
was committed to writing by Appius himself. —haec ille egit: ‘ he
made this speech '. —— septemdecim annis: as the second (alte-
rum) consulship was in 296, and the speech in 280, both these years
are included in the reckoning by a usage very common in Latin.
For the ablative ct. 19. —- censor.. .ante consulatum: this was
unusual, and therefore to Claudius' honor. -—— grandem sanet
‘undoubtedly old ’. — et tamen sic: i. e. eum tum grandemfiasse.
Lahmeyer wrongly says that sic points to the words atque haec ille
egit. It may be noted that sic takes the place of an object atter ac·
cepimus-,⁰ cf. 77 ita crederem ,· 78 sic mt'hi persuasi ,· also 18 male
cogitanti.

17. nihil afferunt: ‘they bring forward nothing ’, i. e. what they

’ bring forward is worthless; so in Greek οὐδὲν λέγειν, the opposite of

 

which is λέγειν τι. Cf. 8 est istm aliquid. similes ut si: a very
rare construction. Equally unusual is similes tamquam si in Div. 2,
131. In Tusc. 4, 41 and off. 1, 87 we find similiter ut si, in F in. 2,
21 and 4, 31 similiter or similis et si, in N. D. 3, 8 similiter ac si ,⁶ also
in Liv. 5, 5, 12 dissimilia ac si, in 35, 42, 10 idem ac si. As regards
the ut after similes, we may compare a few passages in which simul ut
appears for simul ac ,⁰ see Reid’s n. on Academ. 2, 51. In the English
Bible there are expressions like similes sunt ut si qui dicant, ‘ they are
like as if some men should say ’. scandant: ‘ cum is used with the
subjunctive when it expresses a kind of comparison, and especially a
contrast, between the contents of a leading proposition and a subor-

 

dinate (“ whereas ”, etc.) '. Madvig, 3 58, Obs. 3. The underlying idea
in this use is generally cause, sometimes concession. per foros:
‘over the deck ’. — ille: for the omission of sed or autem (asyndeton
adversativum.) see n. on 3 librum, etc. clavum: ‘tiller'. With
this passage Lahmeyer well compares what Cicero says of himself in

 

 

Fam. 9, 1 5, 3 sedebamus in puppi et clavum tenebamus ‚· nunc autem
mlx est in sentina locus. ι·- velocitate: velocitas and celeritas differ
