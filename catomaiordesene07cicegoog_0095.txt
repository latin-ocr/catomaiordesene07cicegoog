sponding to those cardinal numbers which are made up of one and a
multiple of ten, the Latins use unus oftener than primus, which would
be strictly correct ς so in English ‘ one and eightieth ’ for ‘eighty-first ⁹.
The ordinary Grammar rule (Roby, Vol. 1, p. 443 ‘the ordinal not the
cardinal is used in giving the date') requires slight correction. For
the position of the words see G. 94, 33 H. 174, font-note 3. --- scri-

Laert. 3, 2 quoting Hermippus (a Greek writer on biography who
lived about the time of the Second Punic war), says that Plato died in
the middle of a marriage-feast at which he was a guest. Val. Max. 8,
7, 3 gives a slightly different account. — Isocrati z this form of the
genitive of Greek proper names in ·es was probably used by Cicero

. bitur: the periphrasis is common, and the verb inscribere is nearly

always in the present tense (in later prose as well as in Cicero) as in
59. This is sometimes the case even where the neighboring verbs
are in past tenses, as in Acad. 1, 12 nec se tenuit quin contra suum
doctorem librum etiam ederet qui Sosus inscribitur. The present
seems to mean that the name mentioned is continually given to each
copy of the book as produced; where the continuing multiplicatiori of
copies is not looked to, we have the perfect, as Att. 8, 5, 2 tusascicu·
