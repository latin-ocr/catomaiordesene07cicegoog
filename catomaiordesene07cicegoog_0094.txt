cert’s. ——illo exstincto: Fabius died in ²03 B. c. — fore unde
discerem neminemz‘cf. Acad. 1, 8 quae nemo adhuc docuerat nec
erat u nde studiosi scire possent. Unde of persons (here =a quo) is
common in both verse and prose (so ὅθεν 3ηά ὅθενπερ, vid. Liddell
and Scott in vv.); cf. Horace 1, 12, 17 unde nil maius generatur apso ‚-

place of tot, which, like quot, cannot be used as a substantive. —·
Scipiones: ‘rnen like Scipio ’, i. e. the elder Africanus; so 15 Fabri·
cii Curii Coruncanii. Cicero has here put his own opinion of Scipio
into the mouth of Catu, who, during a large part of his life, was a
staunch 3ηά even bitter opponent of Scipi0, and therefore not likely
to couple him with Fabius. Cf. Introd. — ut . . . recordentur: the
repetition of ut with each clause for the sake of effect may be eom·
pared with the repetition of nihil in 15, 27, 413 of non in 323 of hinc
in 40: of sibi in 58. pedestris: for terrestris,· the usage is very
common 3 so in Greek πεζομαχία and ναυμαχία, πεζομαχεῖν and ναυμα-
χεῖν are often contrasted (see Liddell and Scott). It is not recorded
by historians that either Scipio or Fabius took part personally in
naval warfare. recordentur: this verb implies the habitual dwell-
ing of the memory upon the past. quiete et pure atque ele·
gauter: the enumeration consists of two branches connected by et,
the second branch being subdivided into two members connected by
atque. Had each of the adverbs been intended to stand on exactly
the same footing Cic. would have written et instead of atque, or else
would bave omitted the copula altogether3 see n. on 53 capitum ingn-
tio. In enumerations of the form A 4-(5'1 -1-Β-ι), the -1- outside the
bracket is expressed by et, the -4- inside the bracket generally being
expressed by ac, for which atque is substituted when the following
word (i. e. ΒΞ) begins with a vowel, a guttural (c, q, g) or le, before

which ac was very seldom written. -- pure atque eleganter: ⁴ sin

ally ‘in choice fashion’, implies daintiness combined with simplicit)
in regard to the exte-rnal conditions of life. The same ideas are put
