fi INTRODUCTION.

according to GelliuS, exceedingly free. Theophrastus stated
simply his own views and wrote for philosophers ; Cicero wrote
for generalv readerS‚ and put his statements into th‘e mouth of
Laelius, who, as a distinguished Roman general and statesman,
would not be expected to go very deeply into philosophical
questions. Besides this general following of Theophrastus
there are one or two direct imitations of a discourse of Socrates
on Friendship recorded by Xenophon in the Memorabilia.¹ In
ς 3 there is a slight reference to the Theaetetus of ΡΙειῖο.2 Be-
yond these no distinct adaptation of Greek originals can be
traced. It is extremely doubtful whether Cicero in making this
treatise used the Nicomachean Ethics, though he knew of its
existence⁸ and had perhaps read it. Several points of resem-
blance between that work and the Laelius can be accounted for
by the fact that many of Aristotle’s ethical utterances had passed
into commonplaces. Cicero was probably acquainted with
Plato's Lysis, but no direct imitation of it can be pointed out.
Undoubtedly he read and used here and there other Greek
treatises on Friendship which are not now extant. In §45 he
adapts some lines of Euripides which Plutarch says were com-
mented on by Chrysippus in the book Περὶ <baiam the verses
were -so well known, however, that there is no ground for sus-
pecting imitation.

3. Scopa οε THE LAELms.

The Laelius belongs to the ethical works of Cicero. While
the De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum contains Cicero's view's of
the principles of morality‚ the other ethical writings are con-
cerned with the applications of those principles to actual life.
The subject of Friendship‚ to which the Laelius is devoted,
though very little elaborated by modern philosophers‚ held an
