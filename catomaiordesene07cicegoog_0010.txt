The Stoics and Peripatetics were divided by comparatively un-
important differenceS. In Ethics‚ considered by them as almost
the whole of Philosophy, which was itself defined as ‘the art
ot living '‚ the main question between the two schools was the
amount of importance to be attributed to Virtue, ——the Stoics
declaring that in comparison with Virtue all other things sink
into absolute insignificance, while the Peripatetics maintained
that these have a certain though infinitesimally small signifi-
cance. The N ew Academy taught at this time no complete
’“ philosophical system. It simply proclaimed the view that in
the field of knowledge certainty is unattainable‚ and that all the
inqui rer has to do is to balance probabiliti es one against the other.
The N ew Academic, therefore, was free to accept any opinions
which seemed to him to have the weight os probability on their
side, but he was bound to be ready to abandon them when any·
thing appeared which altered his views os the probabilities. He
not only might be, but he> could not help being, eclectic,· that
is, he chose such views promulgated by other schools as seemed
to him at the moment to be most reasonable or probable. Cicero
called himself an adherent os this school. On most points how-
ever, although eclectic, he agreed with the PeripateticS, but with
a decided leaning toward the Stoic ethical system. The Stoic
opinion that it is the duty of the wise man to abstain from public
lise, which the Peripatetics contested, Cicero decisively rejected.
With ‘the Epicureans he had absolutely no sympathy. Up to
this time these schools and their teachings were known to the
Romans only through the medium of the Greek. The only
Latin philosophical literature was Epicurean, and, excepting the
poem os Lucretius (De Rerum Natura), scarcely famous as yet,
consisted entirely of books rudely written, although considerably
read.

Cicero made no claim to originality as a philosopher, nor even
to complete acquaintance with every detail of the Greek systems.¹
