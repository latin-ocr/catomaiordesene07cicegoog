56] NOTES To CATO MAIOR. 101

of prose writers at least, than the other form apum, which probably
was not used by Cic. — omniurn ε --· omnis· generis. -- consi·
tiones . . . insitiones: ‘planting grafting '. On the varieties of
grafting and the skill required for it see Verg. Georg. 2, 73 seq.

55. possum: see n. on 24. ignoscetis: ‘you will excuse
(me) ’. — provectus sum: ‘1 have been carried away ’. Cicero
often uses prolabi in the same sense. — in hac consumpsit:
Cic. probably never, as later writers did, used consumere with a simple
ablative. Curius ε see n. on 15. — a rne : =a mea villa ; cf. n.
on 3 apud quem. —admirari satis non possum: a favorite form
of expression with Cicero; e. g. De Or. 1, 165. -- disciplinam:
‘morals '3 literally ‘teaching '.

56. Curio :⁶ Plutarch, Cat. 2, says the ambassadors found him
cooking a dinner of herbS, and that Curius sent them away with the
remark that a man who dined in that way had no need of gold. The
present was not brought as a bribe‚ since the incident took place after
the war. Curius had become patronus of the SamniteS, and they were
bringing the customary offering of clientes ; see Rep. 3, 40. — ne:
here = num, a rare use; so Fin. 3, 443 Acad. 2, 116. — sed venio

 

 

ad ε so in 51 venio nunc ad. Redeo ad (see n. on 32) might have been
expected here. in agris erant: ‘lived on their farms ’. For

 

 

erant cf. n. on 21 sunt. —id est senes ε cf. 19 n. on senatum. —
si quidem: often written as one word siquidem = εἴπερ. aranti:
emphatic position. — Cincinnato: L. Quinctius Cincinnatus is

said to have been dictator twice; in 458 Β. c., when he saved the Ro-
man army, which was surrounded by the AequianS, and ended the war
in sixteen days from his appointment; in 439, when Maelius was killed
and Cincinnatus was eighty years old. In our passage Cic. seems to
assume only one dictatorship. The story of Cincinnatus at the plough
is told in Livy 3, 26. facturn : the technical term was dicere dicta-
torem, since he was nominated by the consul on the advice of the
senate. — dictatoris: in apposition with cuius.

 

P. 24. -- Maelium : a rich plebeian, who distributed corn in time
of famine and was charged with courting the people in order to make
himself a king. Ahala summoned him before the dictator, and be-
. cause he did not immediately obey, killed him with his own hand.
For this, Ahala became one of the heroes of his nation. See Liv. 4,
13. Cicero often mentions him with praise. Cf in Catil. 1. 33 p.
