— quamvis: = quanmmvtlr. —- effluxisset= subjunctive because
of the mood of posset, to which it stands in subordinate relation.
Cum here is purely temporal. See Roby, 17783 A· 3423 G· 6663 H·
529, 11. posset: see n. on esset above, 3.

5. si. . . soletis . . . sumus: the apodosis and protasis do not
strictly correspond3 the sense really required is ‘if that wisdom for
which you admire me does exist, it lies in this ’, etc. —- utinam . . .
esset: esset here gives a greater appearance of modesty than would
have been expressed by sit: ‘would it were, as it certainly is not ’. A.
2673 G. 2535 H. 483, 2. —cognominez Cato bore the title sapiem
even in his lifetime3 see Introd. Cognomen is used in good Latin to
denote both the family name and the acquired by·name 3 in late Latin

this latter is denoted by agnomen. — in hoe sapientes: but above, 4
rerum sapientiam, not in rebus. The genitive construction is not found
with sapiens used as noun or adjective till late Latin times. ——natu-
ram ducem etc.: Cato's claim to the title of sapiens does not rest
on any deep knowledge of philosophy, but on practical wisdom or
common sense and experience in affairs. Cf. Lael. 6 and 19. In this
passage Cicero has put into Cato’s mouth phrases borrowed from the
Stoic philosophy, which declared the life of virtue to be life in accord·
ance with nature (naturae convenienter vivere ,or ὁμολογουμένως τῇ φύσει
(ἣν). Cf. 71, n. on secundum naturam. tamquam deum: ob-
serve deum not deam, because nature is compared with, and not iden·
tified with, a divine being. Cf. Fin. 5, 43 eam (rationem) quasi deum
ducem subsequens. aetatis: here = mitae, life as a whole. Cf. 2
omne tempus aetate& and n. ; also 13 aetan's. . . senectus,· 33, 64, 82. —
descriptae: ‘composed?; literally ‘written out ’. The reading di-
scriptae, which many editions give, does not so well suit the passage.
Discribere is to map out, plan, arrange, put in order (see 59 dtkm'pta
and dtkcrspttb); the point here lieS, however, not in the due arrange-
ment of the different scenes of a play, but in the careful working out
of each scene. Ab ea must be supplied after descriptae from a qua
above. actum: the common comparison of life with a drama is
also found in 64, 70. 85.——inerti: the sense of ‘ignorant ’, ‘inar-
tistic’ (in, ars), has been given to this by some editors (cf. Hor. Ep.
2, 2, 126 praetulerim scriptor delirus inersque videri, and Cic. Fin. 2,
11 5 artes, quibus qui carebant, inertes a maioribus nominabantur), but
the meaning ‘inactive’, ‘lazy’, ‘slovenly' seems to suit neglectum
better. poeta: nature is here the dramatist.. the drama is life, the
