80 Not-Es To LAELIUS. [37-

Gracchus and his followers took place. For Rupilius cf. 73 and
Introd. p. v. Of Laelius Val. Max. 4, 7, 1 says consilio eius consules
(Rupilius and Laenas) praecipue utebantur. — tanti: see A. 2 52, a:
G. 3793 Η. 404, and n. 1. ——fecisset...putaret: faceret could not
have been written because Gracchus was dead, but the mind having
once been carried back to the past, it is permissible to use the imper·
fects vellet and putaret to denote that so long as Gracchus con tin-
ued to live, the opinion of Blossius co n t i nue d as here described.
On the mood of ficisset see Roby, 1744: A. 321, a; G. 541³ H. 516,
ΙΙ. - etiamne: sc. hoc putares? dixit: sc. se fuisse facturum.
temeritati: ‘infatuation’. illius furoris: n. on 30 virtutis

 

 

 

elus.

P. 16. —hac amentia etc.: observe that in this sentence the
clauses are not connected by particles. The omission is intentional,
suiting the haste of Blossius. Hac amentia=‘in this mad state ’.
— quaestione nova: ‘special court of enquiry '. For nova is
usually written (with quaestio) extra ordinem, or extraordinaria. —
in Asiam...ad·hostis: he joined Aristonicus, the pretender to the
throne of Pergamus, then in arms against the Romans. When Aris-
tonicus was finally defeated, Blossius committed suicide, as his Stoic
tenets permitted him to d0. rei publicae: the country is the
offended party, and the penalty is regarded as a debt due to it. —
peccati: a stronger word* than culpa ; a translation of the Stoic
ἁμαρτήματοςε-εἱη. - peccaveris: perfect subjunctive in the pro-
tasis of a general condition. See references on C. M. 21 exerceas.
— conciliatrix: Cic. is particularly fond of these feminine nouns
in -trix, many of which he manufactured himself3 he frequently ap-
plies thern, as here, to inanimate objects; cf. 89 assentatio adiutrix.
Conctit'atrix occurs in Plautus in the sense of ‘ match-maker ’.
virtutis: = de virtute ; cf. 34 contentio conditionis.

38. si statuerimus ...si simus: double protasis; less awkward
here than in many passage3‚ because the quidem marks the second
protasis as distinctly subordinate to the first. perfecta. ..sapi-
entia etc.: cf. closely 18, 100. — res etc.: ‘the practice would lead
to no wrong ’. Vitium here almost = culpa. On the form viti see n.
on C. M. 1 praemi—ex hoc numero: =ex hor-mn numero, the
latter being a form of expression which Cic. very rarely uses. In
De Or. 2, 56 we have ex . . . nurnero eorum qm',· Vat. 41 in illorum
numero. For the atti-action cf. n. on 2, eum sermonem. -- εἰ...
