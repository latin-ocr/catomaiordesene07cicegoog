26] NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. 73

and poetical. — quod diu: these words must be scanned as a spon·
dee. The i in diu here probably had the sound of our y. A. 347, c;
G. 7173 H. 608, 111.‚n. 2. Allen well compares a line of Publilius
Syrus heu quam multa paenitenda incurrunt vivendo dt'zc. — volt:
indefinite subject. videt: Tischer quotes Herod. 1, 32 (speech of
Solon to Croesus) ἐν ’γὰρ τῷ μακρᾷ χρόνῳ πολλὰ μὲν ἔστιν ἶ δ έ ε ι ν. τὰ
μή τις ἐθέλει, πολλὰ δὲ καὶ παθέειν. tum equidem etc.:
these lineS, as well as those above, occurred in a play of Statius called
Ephesio .· see Ribbeck’s ⁶ Fragmenta '. — senecta: not used by
prose writers before the time of silver Latin. — deputo: this com-
pound is used by the dramatists ancl then does not occur again till
late Latin times. — eumpse: like tpse and reapse (for which see n.
on Lael. 47) this word contains the enclitic particle pe (probably an·
other form of que), found in nem-pe, quis-piam etc., along with se,
which belongs to an old demonstrative pronoun once declined sos, sa,
sum, the masc. and fem. of which are seen in ὁ, ἡ. The form was no
doubt originally eumpsum, like tpsom (ipsum), but has passed into its
present form just as ipsos (nom.) became (pso, then ipse. The only
difference in sense between eumpse and the simple eum is that the
former is more emphatic. The pronoun eumpse is the subject of the
infinitive sentire, but the substantive, senex, to which the pronoun
refers, is not expressed. — odiosum: cf. n. on 4.

26. iucundum . . . odiosum: elliptic, =‘iucundum ’ potius quam
‘odiosum ’ senem esse dicendum est. ut . . . delectantur: cf. Lael.
1013 also below, 29 sapientes senes: neither of these words
is used as an adjective here3 the whole expression =sapiente5, cum
facti sunt senes. levior: cf. the frag‘m. of Callimachus: γηράσκει
δ’ ὁ γέρων κεῖνος ἐλαφρόν· epo ν , τὸν κοῦροι φιλέουσι. coluntur
et diliguntur: colere rather implies the external marks of respect
(cf. coli in 7), diligere the inner feeling of affection. praeceptis
etc.: cf. Off. 1, 122 ineuntis enim aetatis inscitia senum constituenda et
regenda prudentia est. me . . . iucundos: put for me hcc-undum
esse quam vos mihi estis iucundi. The attraction of a finite verb into
the infinitive after quam is not uncommon; cf. n. on 1 quibus me
apsum. Roby, 1784, ὂς A. 336, b, Rem3 H. 524, 1, 2). Minus, be it
observed, does not qualify intellego, but iucundos. sed: here ana·
leptic, i. e. it introduces a return to the subject proper after a digres-
sion3 so in 31. videtis, ut . . .sit: here ut=quo modo ‚· ‘how '.
senectus. . . cuiusque: the abstract senectus is put for senes as in 343
