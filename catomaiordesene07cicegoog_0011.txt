INTRODUCTION. iii

l'n early lise he had studied with enthusiasm and success all the
learning of the Greeks, but especially in the two departments
of Rhetoric and Philosophy, then closely connected, or rather
.. hardly distinguished. He not only sought the society of learned
Greeks, but spent considerable time in study at Rhodes and
Athens, which had become not merely the ‘school of Greece'‚
as Thucydides makes Pericles eall her, but the school of the
civilized world.¹ When, by reason of political troubles, he was
forced to retire to private life, he began to carry out a great plan
for interpreting the best philosophica! writings of the Greeks to
his fellow·countrymen. For this work his liberal views as a
N ew Academic peculiarly fitted him. His usual method was to
take one or two leading Greek works on the subject with which
he was dealing, and to represent freely in his own language their
subject-matter, introducing episodes and illustrations of his own.
He thus presented to the Romans in their own tongue the most
significant portions of the Greek Philosophy ς and in his writings
there has come down to us much, especially of the Post-Aristo-
telian Philosophy, that was doomed to oblivion in the original
Greek. But further than this, to Cicero more than to any other
Roman is due the formation os a Latin philosophical vocabulary,
by which the language was enriched and fitted for the part it
has since taken as the Language of the Learned. While on
many points Cicero’s own views can‘ hardly be determined with
perfect exactness‚ the exalted sentiments and the exquisite liter-
ary finish of his philosophical writings have always won admira‘
tion3 and through them he has exerted no small influence on
the literature and life of modern times.²

1 To judge rightly of Cicero it only necessary to refer for ex·
must be remembered that he was ample to the weight given to the
a politician only by accident: his opinions of Cicero in the heated
whole natural bent was towards political discussions of the six·

literature. teenth and seventeenth centuries.
