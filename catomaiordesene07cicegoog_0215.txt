6] NOTES TO LAELIUS. 47 ·

reference is made to some particular passage. Roby, 1177,- G. 385,
Rem.; H. 425, 2, n. 1. With hoc libro here cf. C. M. 54 in eo libro.
— scripsi de amicitia: it is not often that Cic. leaves out the
object after scribere ,· above in 4 aliquid is added. Sometimes a
qualifying adverb takes the place of the object, as Att. 9, 15, 5 quod
scribe& me asperius quam mei patiantur mores de Dionysio smpmse.
Here the phrase ad amicum amicissimus sottens the construction.
Cflhowever Fam. 9, 16, 13 14, 2, 4. senior...excellens: no-
tice the order of the phraseS, sapiens corresponding with prudentior,
, and senior with amicitiae gloria excellens ,· an instance of chiasmus.
tu,velim...avertas: on velim see A. 311, b; G. 2503 H. 486,
I. n. 1. When Cic. uses the subjunctive construction aster volo he
nearly always leaves out ut, as here. A. 331, fi Rem.; G. 546,
Rem. 35 H. 499, 2. The subject of the dependent verb, if expressed,
always precedes the words velim, vellem, malim and the like, as in
the present passage3 cf. also Tusc. 5, 20 nos vellem praemio elicere
possemus, and Fam. 15, 3, 2. — Laelium...putes: the omission
of a conjunctiora to connect two clauses is particularly common in
Cic. when two clauses are contrasted‚ as here and below, ab his sermo
oritur, respondet Laelius ,· cf. 49, 693 13, 19, 22, 90.

P. 8. — disputatio τ here not ‘ discussion ⁹, but merely ‘ discourse ’ς
cf. De Or. 2, 233 dtis-putes quid sentias,· also n. on 4.-—·-te ipse
cognosces: ‘you will recognize your own likeness '. Cf. 10, me epse ’
consolor ; also 59, 80. In these places spse, not epum, is put tor em-
phasiS, because there is an implied contrast between the subject of ,
the verb and other persons, so that {pser- καὶ αὐτ-δη here ‘you your·
sels, as' well as others '. Cf. C. M. 4 a se ipsi and n. A. 195,l1; G.

2983 H. 452, 1.

6. sunt ista: ‘what you say is true'; sunt etsta (lo-va ταῦτα) and
sunt ista vera are almost equivalent expressions. The phrases esto
(‘be it granted ²) and verum esto are frequently interchanged, as in
Cic. Flacc. 71, 72, 95. -- existimare . .. existimant: the repetition
is a mark ot careless writing. —oculos ...coniectost the cause is
given at the end of 7. -ss— hoc: i. e. ut sapiens et appellaretur et
existimaretur. For the tense of tribuebatur see n. on 37 videbamus.
