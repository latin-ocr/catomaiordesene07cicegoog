lar distinctions were decreed3 the nearest parallel lies in the right
accorded to Paulus Macedonicus and to Pompeius to wear the trium-
phal toga picta for life on each occas'ion of the ludi. It may be con-
jectured that the music and the torch were part of the ceremony on
the evening of a triumph when the triumphator was escorted home.
Cf. Florus 1, 18, ιο, ed. Halm. -— nullo exemplo: ‘without any
precedent ’. -- privatus ε any person is privatus who is not actually
in office at the moment referred to, whether he has led a public life or
not. licentiae: a strong word is used to mark the heinousness
of Duillius’ supposed offence against ancestral custom.

45. alios: sc. nomino. primum: the corresponding deinde is
omitted, as often. —- sodalis: the sodalitates or sodalitia, brother-
hoods for the perpetuation of certain rites accompanied with feasting,
were immemorial institutions at Rome. The clause sodalitates... ac-
ceptis must not be taken to mean that Cicero supposed these brother-
hoods to have been first instituted in the time of Cato; it is only
introduced to show that Cat0, so far from being averse to good living,
assisted officially in the establishment of new clubs. Most of the so-
dalitates were closely connected with the gens ; all members of a gens
were sodales and met together to keep up the old sacra, but in histor-

 

 

ica] times fictitious kinship largely took the place of real kinship, and
feasting became almost the sole raison d’etre of these clubs. [See
Mommsen's treatise De collegiis et sodaliciis Romanis-‚1 The parallel
of the London City Companies readily suggests itself. The national
sodalitates or priesthoods such as those of the Sodales Titii, Luperci,
Augustales etc. were somewhat different. — autern z for the form of
the parenthesis cf. 7. Magnae Matris τ the image of Cybele was
brought to Rome in 204 Β. c. from Pessinus in Phrygia. See Liv. 29,
10. The Sacra are called Idaea from Mount Ida in Phrygia, which

 

was a great centre of the worship of Cybele. Acceptis, sc. in civitatem ‚-
the worship of strange gods was in principle illegal at Rome unless
expressly authorized by the State. -- igitur: the construction of
the sentence is broken by the introduction of the parenthesis, and a
fresh start is made with epulabar igitur. Igitur is often thus used, like
our ⁴ well then '‚ to pick up the broken thread of a sentence. So often
sed or ergo. fervor: Cf. Hor. Od. 1, 16, 22 me quoque pectoris
temptavit in dulci iuventa fervor. — aetatis, qua progrediente ε
‘ belonging to that time of life, but as life advances '. The word aetas
has really two senses here ς in the first place it is bona aetas or iuventus
