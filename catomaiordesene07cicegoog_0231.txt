it. Seneca allows Cato the younger to have been really sapiens. —
optantur: a philosopher who propounds wild theories is often said
by Cicero, optare ‚· cf. Acad. 2, 121 somnia Democriti non docentis sed
optantis ,· Tusc. 2, 30 optare hoc quidem est, non docere ; N. D. 1, 19
optata magis quam inventa ,· Leg. Agr. 1, 1 cogitata sapientium an
optata ficriosorum. Cf. n. on 11.

P. 8. - C. Fabricium: C. Fabricius Luscinus, consul in 282 and

’ 278 and censor in 275 Β. c.‚ commanded against PyrrhuS‚ and was

famed for his 'integrity. One of Pyrrhus’ suite is said to have made
an offer to Fabricius to poison the king 3 Fabricius merely sent to
inform the king that there was a plot against his life. — Μ’. Cu-
rium: see n. on C. M. 15 Fabricii. Ti. Coruncanium: the
close friend of Dentatus (see 39); commanded with distinction
against the Etruscans in 280 B..c.; in C. M. 27 he is mentioned as
one of those quorum usque ad extremum spiritum est provecta pru·
dentz'a. — iudicabant: esse omitted as with interpretantur above.
— normam: ‘standard '. — sibi habeant: cf. the formal ex·
pression used by a Roman husband in divorcing his wife—tuas res
tibi habeto. —invidiosum et obscurum: ‘arrogant and unintelli-
gible ’. -— concedant ut: when concedere means to give permission
to do something' it regularly takes ut with subjunctive, but when it
means to admit a fact it is regularly followed by the accusative with
infinitive. The subjoined passage shows the distinction; Rosc. Am.
54 concedo tibi ut ea praetereas quae, cum taces, nulla esse concedit.

 

Sometime8‚ however, Cicero substitutes the subjunctive construction
for the infinitive (but not vice versa) as in our passage and Fin. 5, 78
si Stoicis concedis· ut virtus sola vitam efficiat beatam. In such passages
the effect of the admission is rather looked to than the admission
itself. The meaning here is ‘let them make such an admission as to
bring it about that these were good men ’. — sapienti: a datibus
commodi.

19. pingui Minerva: ‘with our gross wits’. Another form of
the proverb is crassa Mamer-va,- cf. also Cic. Off. 1, 110 invtta lm·-
nerva; Hor. A. P. 385. Asinerva in these phrases stands for ‘wits’
or ‘intellect ’. The expressions ut aiunt (22), quod aiunt, or aiunt
simply (Hor. Sat. 2, 2, 64), also id quod aiunt (Terent. Phorm. 506),
ut dicitur (Lael. 97 and 101), and quod dicitur (67) are often inserted
parenthetically (like τὸ λεγόμενον) to indicate a proverb. — fides
...liberalitasz these words must be taken in two pairs with a pause
