78 NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. [28—

n. with the whole passage cf. Plin. Ep. 3, 1, 2 nam iuvenes confina
adhuc quaedam et quasi turbata non indecent: sem'bus placida omnia
et ordinata conveniunt. — facit audientiam: ‘ procures of itself a
hearing for it '. In the words per se ipsa there is no doubt an allusion
to the custom at large meetings in ancient times whereby the praeco or.
κῆρυξ called on the people to listen to the speakers. Cf. Liv. 43, 16,
8 praeconem audientiam facere iusst’t. Note that this is the only clas-
sical use of the word audientia,- it has not the meaning of our ‘ aucli-
ence’ either in the sense of a body of listeners, or as used in the
expression ‘to give audience '. — composita et mitis: ‘unimpas-
sioned and smooth '. Cf. Quintil. 6, 2, 9 affectus igitur hos concitatos,
illos mitis atqqce compositos esse dixerunt. quam . . . nequeas ε
‘ and if you cannot practise oratory yourself’. Evidently quam refers
to oratio in the widest sense, not to the special style of oratory men-
tioned in the last sentence. With si nequeas cf. nisi exerceas in 21
with n. — Scipioni e't Laelioz ‘a Scipio and a Laelius’; i. e.
‘young friends such as Scipio and Laelius are to me’. -- prae-

 

cipere: here absolute, = praecepta dare ; usually an accusative fol-
lows. — studiis iuventutis: ‘the zeal of youth ⁹. Studiis· does not
imply here the deference of youth to age; the studia meant are the
virtutum studt‘a of 26.

29. ne . . . instruat: docere is to impart knowledge, instituere (lit-
erally ‘to ground’ or ‘establish') is to form the intellect and char·
aeter by means of knowledge, instruere, to teach the pupil how he may
bring his acquirements to bear in practical life. -- offici munus :⁴
‘performance of duty'3 cf. 35, 723 Fam. 6, 14. In scores of passages
in Cicero we find afficiam et munus, ‘ duty and function ', as in 34. —-
Cn. et P. Scipiones: in Cic. the plural is always used where two
men of the same family are mentioned and their names connected by
et. In other writers the plural is regular, the singular exceptional, as
in Sall. Iug. 42, 1 Ti. et C. Gracchus ,· Liv. 6, 22 Sp. et L. Papirius.
Even with other nouns the plural is regular; e. g. Cic. Phil. 2, 101
arationes Campana et Leontina, though a little above we have m e nse
Aprili atque Maio. [See Draeger‚ Hist. Synt. 12, p. 1.] Gnaeus (not
Cnaeus —see n. on Lael. 3) Cornelius Scipio was consul in 222 Β. c.
and was sent to Spain at the outbreak of the Second Punic war to
command against Hasdrubal. Publius was consul in 218, and after
being defeated by Hannibal at the Ticinus, joined his brother in
Spain. At first they won imp‘ortant successes, but in 212 they were
