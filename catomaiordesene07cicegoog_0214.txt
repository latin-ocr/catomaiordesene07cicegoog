5 haec Academica, ut scis, cum Catulo Lucullo Hortensio contuleram.
Sane in personas non cadebant ,· ib. 13, 16, 1 ecce tuae litterae de Var-
rone. Nemini visa est aptior Ἀντιοχεία ratio. — loqueretur: Cic.
very frequently uses loqui (but not dicere) when the subject is an
abstract noun, as here persona practically is. So Fin. 2, 48 consuetudo
loquitur ‚· ib. 4, 41 institutio hominis si loqueretur ; Acad. 2, 101 con·
clusi’o loquitur. For the mood see n. on dissereret below. — floru-
isset : at first sight this seems a reference to the physical and mental
powers for which Cato was famous in advanced age. Cic„ however,
does not use florere in the sense of vig-ere ,· Nauck therefore is prob-
ably right in supposing the word to refer to the general worldly
prosperity of Cato, indicated in C. M. 8. On the subjunctive see A.
320, e; G. 636; H. 517. —maxime memorabilem: superlatives
from adjectives in -bilis are rare. In 51 we have amabilissimum ,·
Cato has stabilissimus, Columella mirabilissimam, and mobilissimus is
common3 these are all the instances which appear until post-Augus·
tan timeS. Several adjectives of this claSS, as laudabilis, probabilis,
flebilis, have comparatives, but no superlatives, in pre-Classical or
Classical Latin. — disputata: it is not necessary to supply esse so
as to make this a case of the perfect infinitive after meminisset. Dis-
putare aliquid (cf. n. on 1) often means not ‘to discuss an opinion ',
but ‘to put an opinion forward in discussion ’, and so to defend or
maintain it.——dissereret: A. 320, f; G. 633: H. 503, 11. 2. —
meminisset: A. 3423 G. 631: H. 529, 11. — genus boc ser-
monum : = sermones huius generis ,· cf. 12 quo de genere mortis ;
93 quod genus amici. —— positum: A. 290, a: G. 669; H. 549, 1.
-— hominum veterum: ‘ men of the olden time '. -— et eorum:
introduced for sake of emphasis. G. 293, Rem. 23 H. 451, 2. —-
nescio quo pacto: ‘somehow ⁹. See A. 334, e; G. 469, Rem. 23
H. 529, 5, 3). mea: sc. scripta, as in Acad. 1, 8 nihil magno
opere meorum miror.

⁵. senem senex: at the time the Cato Maior was written Atticus
was 65 and Cic. 62. Note the fondness of Cic. as well as of other
Latins for bringing ·into juxtaposition different cases of the same
word. So De Or. 2, 310 rebus res and Lucr. 1, 359 res rebus ,· cf.
also below, 25 iustitiam iustissimo. See A. 344, g3 G. 6833 H. 563.
—-— hoc libro: this corresponds to tum above; num would have
been more formally correct3 so below tum . ..nana Liber is put in
the abl. without in when the whole book is referred το, with in when
