The word is, literally, ‘to stand firm ', ‘to get a firm foothold’.

P· 81.—⁷⁵. L. Brutum: fell in single combat with Aruns, son
of the exiled Tarquin3 see Liv. 2, 6. The accusatives Brutum etc.
are not the objects oi recorder but the subjects of infinitives to be sup-
plied from profectas. duos Decios: see n. on 43. — cursum
equorum: the word equos would have been sufficient; but this kind
of pleonasm is common in Latin3 see n. on Lael. 30 causae dilngmdi.
— Atilius: i. e. Regulus, whose story is too well known to need
recounting. There are many contradictions and improbabilities about
it. -- Scipiones: see n. on 29. In Paradoxa 1, 12 Cic. says of
them Carthaginiensium adventum corporibus suis intercludendum puta-
verunt. -—- Poenis: on the dat. see A. 235,a; H. 384, 4, n. 2. —-
Paulum: n. on 29 L. Aemilius. -- collegae: M. Terentius Varro.
There is no reason to suppose that he was a worse general than many
other Romans who met Hannibal and were beaten; the early histo-
rians‚ being all aristocrats, fixed the disgrace of Cannae on the demo-

from reproaching him, the Senate commended his spirit, and several
times afterwards entrusted him with important business. —- Mar-
cellum: the captor of Syracuse in 212 Β. c. He fell into an ambush
in 208 and was killed; Hannibal buried him with military honors. —
cuius interitum: abstract ior concrete =quem, post interitum. —-
crudelissimus hostis: this, the traditional Roman view oi Hannibal,
is the reverse of the truth, so far as extant testimony goes. See
Mommsen, Hist. of Rome, Bk. ΙΙΙ. Ch. 43 Ihne, Hist. of Rome, Bk.
IV. —- sed .. . arbitrarentur: these words are almost exactly re-
peated in Tusc. 1, 89 and 101. — rustici: cf. Arch. 24 nostri illi
sortes viri sed mstici ac milites ,· also above, 24.

⁷6. omnino: see n. on 9. — num igitur etc.: cf. 33 nisi sorte
et seq. constans: cf. n. on 33. -- ne quidem: see n. on 27.
satietas vitae ι cf. 85 senectus autem et seq„ and satietas vivendi
in pro Marc. 273 also Tusc. 1, 109 vita acta perficiat ut satis superque
mlx-asse videamur.

77. cernere: oi the mind also in 82. With the context cf. Div. 1,
63 animus appropinquante morte multo est divinior ; facilius evenit appro-
pinquante morte ut animi fictura augurentur. vestros patres τ n.
