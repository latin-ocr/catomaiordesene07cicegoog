108 non-:s To CATO MAIOR. [65-

— Adelphisx Adesphi --- ἀδελφοί, The Brothers; this play of Ter
enee is still extant. diritas: ‘ harshness of temper ’ς but Suet.
Tib. 21 has din‘tas morum, and Varro scena quem senem Latina vidit
dirissimum. Both dirus and diritas are rare in Cicero; the former
word does not once occur in the whole range of the speeche3‚ the
latter scarcely excepting here and in Vat. 93 in Tusc. 3, ²9 Cic. uses it
in translating from Euripides.

P. 28. -66. sollicitam habere: ‘to keep in trouble ’. Sollzkitus
is, literally, ‘wholly in motion ³, from sollus, which has the same root
with ὅλος, and citus ; cf. the rare words sollg'fides, sollg‘ferreus. The
perfect participle with habeo emphasizes the continuance of the effect
produced. Zumpt, 6343 A. 292, c; G. ²303 H. 388, 1, n. — nos-
tram aetatem: cf. n. on 26 senectus. — esse longe ε more usually
abesse. 0 miserum: Ὀ, wretched is that old man ’. Cicero
oftener joins 0 with the accusative than with the nominative: he
rarely, if ever, uses the interjection with the vocative in direct address
to persons. extinguit animum: the doctrine of the annihilation
of the soul after death was held by many of Cicero's contemporaries,
professedly by the Epicureans (e. g. LucretiuS, De Rerum Nat. 3, 417
et seq. ; cf. also Caesar's argument at the trial of the Catilinian con·
spiratorS‚ Sall. Bell. Catil. c. 51, Cic. in Catil. 3, c. 4), practically by
the Stoics, who taught that there is a future existence of limited though
indefinite length. —- deducit: cf. n. on 63. — atqui: see n. on 6.
— tertium . . . potest ε ‘ nothing can be found as a third alternative ἐ
so in Tusc. 1, 82 quoniam nihil tertium est.

 

 

 

6⁷. quid timeam etc.= so Tusc. 1, 2 5 quo modo {gitur aut cur mor·
tem malum tibi videri dicis· Ρ quae aut beatos nos efficiet, animis manen·
tibus. aut non miseros, sensu carentis ; ib. 1, 118 ut aut in aeter'nam
domum remigremus aut omni sensu careamus. For mood see A. 268;
G· 2515 H· 486, 11· —— aut non miser . . . aut beatus: a dilemma,
but unsound and not conclusive; for non miser is used with reference
to annihilation, and the soul may exist after death in a state of unhap-
piness. — futurus sum: see n. on 6 flaturum est. quamvis
sit: prose writers of the Republican period use quamvis with the sub-
junctive only3 see Roby, 1624, 1627; A. 313, a‚g; G. 6083 H· 515, 111·
and n. 3. -— cui: see n. on 38 viventi. — ad vesperum esse
victurum: ‘that he will be alive when evening comes’‚ not ‘that he
will live till the evening'. With the prepositions ad, sub, in the form
vesper is generally used, not vespera. With this passage cf. Fin. 2, 9²
