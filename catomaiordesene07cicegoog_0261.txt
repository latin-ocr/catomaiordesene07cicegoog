58] NoTEs To LAELms. 93

amicum, quo in se tpsum ,· also the whole passage there from 65 to 70.
— alteram: this is the opinion of those who regard friendship as a
barter of services ; see below, 58. -- pariter aequaliterque: n. on
32 pares etc. —— quanti: see n. on 37 tanti.

57. prorsus: goes with nulli, not with assentiam ‘ to none at all '.
—faceremus etc.= for the sense cf. 26. causa amicorum:
the repetition of causa, which is often left out in the second place, as
in 46, is no doubt due to the desire to complete the chiasmus.
precari: note the omission of aliquid. — supplicare: sc. alu-ui. —

 

 

 

acerbius invehi insectari vehementius: cbiasmuS. non satis:
‘ not very ’. — multaeque res sunt etc.; not for multaeque aliae
res sunt etc„ but this clause repeats and gives more exactly the gen-
eral statement contained in the words quam multa . ..amicorum —
viri boni etc.: it will be seen that in this section Cicero gives a 'pecu-
liar turn to the meaning of the first opinion of the three above enumer-
ated. He takes it to imply that a man must always act with regard
to his friend just as he would in his own case, but the opinion itseli
probably had regard not to action but to feeling and implied that lo v e
between friends should be equal. It is in this sense that Cic. himself
understands the opinion in Tusc. 3, 73 praeclarum illud est et, si quae-
ris, rectum quoque et verum ut eos qui nobis carissimi esse debeant aeque
ac nosmet ipsos amemus. The opinion in fact was an answer to the
question discussed by Aristotle in Eth. Nic. 9, c. 8 πότερον δεῖ φιλεῖν
ἑαυτὸν μάλιστα ἢ ἄλλον τινά and in the words of the next clause it
definiebat amicitiam paribus voluntatibus.

58. definit: ⁴ restricts friendship to an equal interchange of services
and feelings’. — exigue et exiliter: ‘with minuteness and exact·
ness’. -— calculos: properly the pebbles used in the abacus for
counting; here ‘to an account ⁹. Cf. faeneramur in 31. ratio
acceptorum: cf. closely 26, 31. -- datorum: the usual contrast to
acceptorum in the language of Roman book-keeping is expensorum.
The phrase accepti expensique ratio ‘ a debtor and creditor account ’ is

 

 

common. divitior: Cic. uses this form, not ditior, and divitissi-
mus, not ditissimus. — observare eto: Aristode, Eth. Nic. 8, 7 and
8, 13, 1 lays down that there is a class of friendships καθ’ ὑπεροχήν
where there cannot be an equal exchange of services.

P. 23. - acceperit: subjunc. with quam. A. 332, b; H. 502, 2.
— neque enim etc.: i. e. if the friendship be true all such fears
fall to the ground. —— excidat . . . defluat . . . congeratur: the meta·
phors are all from measuring articles of commerce.
