property belonging to the state, and all goods captured from the
enemy were sold for the benefit of the exchequer. On leaving
the province Cato made an unusually large gift to each soldier,
saying that it was better for all to bring home silver than for a
few to bring home gold. The provincials were thoroughly con-
tent with their ruler and ever after looked on him as their best
friend. The army was kept in the strictest discipline. Some
disorderly conduct of the equites was rebuked by Cato in a bitter
harangue which he afterwards published. Partly by craft, partly
by good leadership in the field, Cato broke the strength of the
turbulent natives and returned to enJ'oy a well-earned triumph.¹
In the same year (194) a brilliant triumph was celebrated by
Flamininus.

Scipio, probably uneasy at the great reputations quickly won
by Flamininus and Cato, secured his second consulship for the
year 194, but failed to achieve anything remarkable. Cato prob-
ably spent the three years after his return for the most part at
his Sabine sarm. When the war against Antiochus broke out,
he took service along with his friend Flaccus on the staff of the
consul Glabrio‚² and by a difficult march over the mountains
broke in on the king's rear, and so was chiefly instrumental in
winning the great battle of Thermopylae, by which Antiochus
was driven out of Greece. Immediately after the battle Cato
returned home with despatcheS. We have dim and uncertain
information that he took the field once or twice again, but his
career as a soldier was practically ended.

From this time to his death, forty years later, Cato was the
leading figure on the stage of Roman politics. In season and
out of season he attacked abuses or innovations in speeches
addressed to the senate, the people‚ or the courts. Soon after
his return from Thessaly he struck a heavy blow at the unrepub-
lican honor-hunting among the magistrates, of which the example
