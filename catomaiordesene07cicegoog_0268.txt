100 NOTES TO LAELIUS. [72-

hardly ever so strong in meaning as our word ‘ despise ’, which is com·
monly used to translate it. See n. on C. M. 43 spreta et contempm.
—- contingit: n. on 8. — qui: ‘and they ⁹.

⁷8. ille: sc. possit. —- non...neque: cf. n.·on ro. There is a
slight anacoluthon, the form oi the sentence being changed; tor the
proper clause introduced by a second neque the clauses introduced by
ut are substituted. Cf. n. on 45 partim. The unemphatic m should
be noticed; it is our English ‘ you ’ for ‘ one ⁹. — excellas: cf. excel·
lentiae in 69. — perducere: i. e. through all the various grades·
Producere (which some editions have) is simply ‘to advance ’, without
the notion of gradation. —- potuit ...non potuit: cf. n. on 19. In
Tusc. 4, 40 Rupilius is said to have taken his brother’s defeat greatly
to heart; and Pliny, Nat. Hist. 7, 5 122 enlarges the story by making
him die immediately on hearing the result of the election. — effi-
cere: facere would not do here, since facere aliquem consulem means
‘to vote for some one's election as consul '.

⁷4. corroboratis . . . aetatibus: the confirmata or corroborata aetas
is the time of life immediately succeeding youth, the καθεστηκυῖα ἡλικία
of Thucydides; cf. pro Caelio 41 qua varietate non modo haec aetas sed
t‘czm corroborata caperetur. The opposite expression is infirmissimum
tempus aetati} in Acad- 2, 9; Flacc. 5. —-— habere: the construction
is carried on as though oportet iudei-are de ama-itit} or something similar
had preceded; old edd. indeed insert oportet, which is unnecessary.
In Fin. 2, 103 quod si dies notandus fiat, eumne potius quo natus an
eum quo sapienssactus est the words oportet notare have to be supplied
from notandus. In his n. there Madvig excellently illustrates the
usage both from Latin and from Greek. —isto modo: ‘on that
principle ’. — nutrices et paedagogi: at Rome these were gener-
ally slaves. ——vetustatisz n. on 68. -— quidem: here concessive,
‘I admit ’, as in 13. —— alio quodam modo: n. on 6. — mores
etc.: mores is probably in the accusative, not, as Lahm. suggests,
in the nominative == homines dtis-paribus moribus ,· homines sequuntur
studia is certainly not Latin. For the morum similitudo as a necessary
condition of friendship cf. 15, 27, 33 (mutari .. . mores), 503 also Aris-
totle, Eth. Nic. 8, 1, 63 8, 3, 6: 8, 8, 5; 9, 3, 3. -—— boni...possunt:
cf. 18. — nisi quod: used after negative statements to introduce a
limitation or exception. Madvig, 442, c, Obs. 33 G. 592, Rem. 3; H.
555, 111. 1. — distantia: a vox Ciceroniana. The word is in good
Latin never used of distance in space. Aristotle several times dis·
