nence Cicero's care to avoid in the dedication all but the
vaguest possible allusions to politicS. Had that introduction
been written before Caesar's death, we should have had plain
allusions (as in the prooemia of the Academica, the De Finibus,
the T asculan Disputatious, and the De Natura Deorum) to

Caesar's dictatorship.¹

The time was one of desperate gloom for Cicero. The down-

Antonius. The deep wound caused by his daughter’s death²
was still unhealed. It is easy to catch in the Cato Maior some
echoes of his grief for her. When it is said that os all Cato's
titles to admiration none is higher than the fortitude he showed
in bearing the death of his son‚⁸ the writer¹ is thinking of the
struggle he himself had been waging against a like sorrow for
more than a year past3 and when Cato expresses his firm con·
viction that he will meet his child beyond the grave,⁴ we can

clearly indicated, in several parts of the work. Passages from
Xenophon’s Oeconomicus are translated in Chapters 17 and 22.
In Chapters 2 and 3 there is a close imitation of the conversa·
tion between Socrates and Cephalus at the beginning of Plato’s
Republic‚ while in Chapter 21 is reproduced one of the most
