41] NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. 87

serve the singular patriae followed by the plural ‘rerum publicarum3
the plural of patria is rare. On the significance of this passage see
Lecky, Hist. of European Morals, Ι. p. 211, n. (Am. ed.). — cum
hostibus etc.= attributive phrase3 cf. Phil. 12, 27 colloquia cum acer·
rimis hostibus. —- scelus: this word looks chiefly to the criminal
intention, whether it be carried into action or not, malum, facinus to the
completed crime ; flagitium is siri rather than crime. Facinus in sense
is often rather narrower and lighter than scelus ; cf. Verr. 5, 170 saci·
nus est vincire civem Romanum, scelus verberare, prope parn‘cidium
necare. impelleret: sc. homines ; so nos is omitted after iubebat
below. — excitari: ‘stirred up ⁹. In 39 and 41 we have the verb
in·citare ‚· for the difference between the two verbs cf. Qu. Fr. 1, 1, 45
haec non eo dicuntur, ut te orata> mea dormientem excitasse,
sedpotius ut currentem ,incitasse videatur. —— homini . . . de·
disset: cf. Acad. 1, 7 nec ullum arbitror maius aut melius a dis datum
munus homini. Notice homini ‘ man ’, in the same sense as hominibus.

often found together; the differ-enee in meaning is hardly perceptible
Donum implies the fact of giving, munus the generosity of the giver.
— tam . . . inimicum: notice the separation of tam from inimicum

41. libidine := ἐπιθυμίας temperantia = σωφροσύνη. Dominari is
a very strong word, ‘ to tyrannize ’ς domimo = τυραννίς. For locum
cf. Lael. 52 in tyranni vita nullus locus est amicitiae. consistere:
‘find a foothold'. Cf. Fin. 4, 69 sapientia pedem ubi poneret
non habebat. — fingere animo: ‘to imagine ⁹. — tanta...
quanta maxima: ‘the greatest that could possibly be enjoyed’.
The form of expression is common, e. g. Lael. 74 tanta quanta maxima
potest esse amantia. —- tam diu dum : this is not exactly equivalent
to the ordinary tam diu quam, but there is ellipsis -— ⁸ so long as this,
1 mean while etc.'. Cf. Cat. 3, 16 tam diu, dum urbis moenibus con·
tinebatur,· Off. 1, 2 tam diu...quoad... —mente...ratione...
cogitatione: ‘ by thought, by reasoning, by imagination ’. Cogitatio
like διάνοια has often the sense of ‘ imagination ’. The close juxtapo-
sition of words nearly synonymous is quite characteristic of Cicero's
Latin. quidem: concessive, as in 32 and often. —-— maior
atque longior: ‘very intense and protracted'. Superlatives might
