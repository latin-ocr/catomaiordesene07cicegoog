86 N OTES TO LAELIUS. g [45-

tentional; cf. 22 vita m'talt's. Cf. also Lucr. 2, 1095. quas: here
= ita ut eas. — adducas . . . remittas: for adducere ‘ to draw tight '
cf. Verg. Aen. 9, 587 a. habenas} Liv. 9, ro ‚quin adducis lorum ἓ For
the position of cum velis see n. on 8 cum summe· viri tum amis-altdeni.
— caput: ‘the chief matter-’3 cf. maximum est in 69. -— beate
vivendum: in the Latin of Cicero’s time there was no one word to
represent the Greek sbammvla= happiness. Cic. himself in one pas·
sage (N. D. r, 95) coined beatitas and beatitudo, but did not again use
the words, though they became current later. Cf. 84 beata vita.
securitatem: Cic. uses this word as well to express the ebo-mla
(‘cheerfulness ⁸) of Democritus, as the ἀπάθεια (‘ absence of emotion ’)
of the StoicS, and the ἡδονή of Epicurus. (Seyffert). —— tamquam
parturiat: a hesitating translation of ὧδίνειν in the passage of Euripi-
des (1. 2 59) 3 cf. n. on 49 redamare.

46. alios: the Cyrenaics and Epicureans3 cf. 52 homines dem-iic
dgffluenles. dicere aiunt: see n. on C. M. 27 deltisse. inhu-
manius: cf. humanius in Fin. 2. 82 where Cic. contrasts the sordid
view of friendship put forward by Epicurus himself with the gentler
views of his later followers. -— locum: ‘topic ’. — ante: 26 seq.
——habereu in quotations Cic. often puts the past tense where we
should expect the present; e. g. N. D. 1, 40 idemque this-putat aethera
esse eum quem homines Iovem appellarent. The change to quae-
rant is odd. See Roby, 15173 Madvig, 382, Obs. 23 A. 287, ἃς G.
5193 cf. H. 495, V. — appetere: = ἐπιθυμεῖν, ἐφίεσθαις different
from κραίνει-προαιρεῖσθαι. - mulierculae: this diminutive here
expresses pity: often however contempt; cf. γύναιον.

P. 19.—47. praeclaram: ironical‚ as often: cf. in Cat. 1, 28:
Tusc. 1, 49. — solem enim etc.: cf. closely 20, 22, and for the meta·
phor Att. 9, 10, 3 sol, ut est in tua quadam epistula, e caelo cecidit. —
a dis: sc. datum. quae: almost = quanti, ⁴ of what worth? ’ —
blanda: ‘enticing’: an epithet often applied to the Epicurean ἡδονή
(voluptas). —- reapse: cf. the common contrast between λόγῳ and
ἔργῳ. Corssen 11² 847 quotes from Festus a fragment of a speech by
Scipio where reque eapse occurs. We have i-p-se and in Plautus cap-se,
eum-pnse, eam-p-se. All these words contain the enclitic particle pe
which appears in nem-pe, quis-p-iam etc.: also the remains of a lost
demonstrative pronoun once declined so·s, sa, sum, the same in fact as
the definite article ὁ, ἦ in Greek. The only difference in meaning
between reapse and the simple re is one of emphasis. See n. on C. M.
