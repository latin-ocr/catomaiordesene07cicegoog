aud proceeds to account for that answer. — excursionex a military
term = ‘skirmishing’3 cf. Div. 2, 26 prima orationis excursio. ·—·
hastis: loosely used for pilis. The long old Roman hasta, whence
the name hastati, had long before Cato’s time been discarded for the
pilum or short Javelin, which was thrown at the enemy from a dis-
tance, before the troops closed and used the sword. —-— consilium:
the repetition of consilium in a different sense from that which it had
in the sentence before seems to us awkward; but many such repeti·
tions are found in Cicero. Consilium corresponds to both ‘ counsel ’⁶
and ‘ council ’3 the senate was originally regium consilium, the king’s
body of advisers. Here translate summum consilium ‘the supreme
deliberative body ⁹. — senatum: ‘ assembly of elders ’. Cf. 56 sena·
tores, id est senes. Senatus implies a lost verb send-re, to be or grow
old, from the stem of which both send-tus and senei-tor are derived.
This stem again implies a lost noun or adjective senus, old. The word
senatus was collective, like comitatus, a body of companionS, excreans,
a trained band etc.

Spartan γερουσία, as it is commonly called, consisted of 28 members,
all over 60 years of age. Herodotus uses the term γέροντες (senes) for
this assemblyg Xenophon γεροντία. In the Laconian dialect γερωΐα
was its name3 we also find γεροντεύειν ‘to be a senator ‘. For ut...
sic cf. Academ. 2, 14, similiter vos cum perturbare, ut illi rem publicam,
sic vos philosophiam velitis‚· also Lael. 19. audire: like ἀκούω,

 

used especially of historical matterS, since instruction in them was
almost entirely oral. Cf. ἀνήκοος-τι ‘ignorant of history ’. vole-
tis: see note on 7 faciam utpotero‚· cf. Roby, 1464, a; Madvig, 339,
Obs. ις Α. 278, b; G. 234, Rem. 15 H. 470, 2. — adulescentibus:

 

Cic„ when he wrote this, was possibly thinking of Athens and Alci·
biades. labefactatas: the verb labefacto is foreign to good prose,
in which labqfacto is used. -- sustentatas: Cic. does not use susten·
ms. In Mur. 3 sustinenda is followed by sustentata in the same *sen-
tence. -- cedo . . . cito: the line is of the kind called tetrameter
iambic acatalectic (or octonarius), and is scanned thus :—

In all kinds of iambic verse the old Romans freely introduced spon·
dees where the Greeks used iambi; so in hexameters spondees for
dactyls. Cf. Hor. Ep. ad. Pis. 254 et seq. cedo: =dic ; from ce,
