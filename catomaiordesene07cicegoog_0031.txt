IN TRODUCTION. xxii

There was much in Scipio that would attract Cato. Unlike
the elder Africanus, he was severe and simple in his outward life,
and though a lover of Greek and Greeks, yet attached to all that
was best in the old Roman character and polity. Though an
opponent of revolution, he was far from being a partisan of the
oligarchy. Altogether, of all Romans, he most nearly deserved
the description, ‘ ἀνὴρ τετράγωνος ἄνευ ψόγου,’ ‘ a man four-square
without reproach.’ In his De Re Publica, Cicero points to
Scipio as the ideal statesman, and often elsewhere eulogizes
him as an almost perfect Roman.

(3.) Laelius. Gaius Laelius, born about 186, was Scipio’s most
distinguished officer before Carthage, and his most intimate
friend throughout life. The fflendship of the two was one of
the most famous in antiquity, and is celebrated in the Laelius.
Laelius was an able speaker, writer and soldier, and devoted to
Greek learning, particularly to the Stoic philosophy. He is with
Cicero the type of a man of culture.² He, too, is one of the
interlocutors in the De Re Publica.
