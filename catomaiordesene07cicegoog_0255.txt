48] NOTEs ‘ro LAELms. 87

2 5 eumpse. —- multis locis: not different in sense from 48 multis
in rebus. For locis cf. 22 nullo loco, pluribus locis. consenta-
neum: ‘consistent '‚ i. e. ‘with your other actions '. — rem: ε
πρᾶγμας actionem = πρᾶξιν ‘course of action'. — fugimus: ‘in-
tend to avoid'3 the continuous sense of the present tense frequently
borders on a future meaning. —- aspernetur: sc. ut. —— bonitas:
‘kindheartedness ’ς little different from benevolentia in 19. ma-
litiam: ‘evil-heartedness', ‘ill-will ’. —— temperantia: σωφροσύνη,
‘ sels-control ', particularly with regard to bodily pleasures. vi-
deas: see ref. on 5 velim. —·-— modestus: not ‘modest ⁹, but ‘law-
abiding ’; here almost equivalent to our ‘ respectable ².

48. cadit in: ‘belongs to '‚ ‘affects’, ‘falls within the province
of '3 a favorite phrase with Cic.; e. g. Acad. 1, 42 ς Tusc. 3, 12 cadere,
opinor, in sapientem aegritudinem tibi dixisti videri ‚· below, n. on 100.
— aliquas: note the-difference to the sense which ullas for aliquas
would make—the difference between getting rid of some actual
troubles (aliquas) and all possible troubles (ne...ullas). —
motu animi: to be taken in a wide sense, as the context showS, both

of emotions and of intellectual perceptions. The Stoics taught that
the wise man should be absolutely unaffected by emotion‚ which they
regarded as sinful. Cf. Tusc. lv, passim. Cf. n. on 10 incommodis.
— dico: this has for its real object the whole phrase inter pecudem
et hominem, which may be treated as though between inverted com-
maS, as also the whole phrase from inter hominem to eiusdem. Some·
times Cic. uses non dicam for non dico in such sentences. Cf. also n.
on ne dicam in 82. truncum aut saxum: Cicero was no doubt
thinking when he wrote this of the line in the Odyssey (19, 163) οὔ
γὰρ ἀπὸ δρυός ἐσσι *allambe-ov, οὐδ’ ἀπὸ πέτρης, which he imitates also
in Acad. 2, 101. ¹For truncus cf. N. D. 1, 84 qui potest esse in eius
modi trunco sapientia ? isti: the Stoics. —-— quandam: often
used with an adjective to sosten the statement. H. 456, 2. Cf. in
Greek the use of τὶς as in Xen. Mem. 1, 3, 12 ὡς δεινήν τινα λέγεις
δύναμιν τοῦ φιλήματος εἶναι. volunt: n. on 29; also volt esse in
98. cum . . . tum: ‘as . . . so ’. — bonis . .. incommodis : = re·
bus secundtls...adversis in 17. diffundatur: sc. virtus, put here,
after Cicero's fashion, for vir praeditus virtute. When the mind is
expanded it is supposed to feel pleasure‚ when contractui, pain. The
Stoics used the terms διαχεῖσθαι and συστέλλεμθαι, διάχυσις and συ·
στολή. -- non . .. repudientur: the sentence is elliptic for non plus
