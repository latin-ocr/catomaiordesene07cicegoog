92 NOTES TO LAELI US. [54η

omnem ratz’onem humanitatis Ρ Cornif. ad Herenn. 4, 2 5 contrasts the
commodus with the vir intolerabili superbia. —imperio potestate:
originally potestas at Rome had a very wide meaning, denoting all
power exereised by public authority and so including imperium. Then
as certain officers (consul, praetor, dictator) had imperium, while
others (censor, aedile, etc.) had not, the word potestas came to be par-
ticularly used in connection with the latter class of officers. Trans,
‘ by power and office '. sperni: the words from sperni to novis are
explanatory of immutari ,· in such cases the connecting et is often left
out -— an usage called by grammarians asyndeton explic-alivum. On
novis (sc. amicitiis) dat. after impers. passive, see Madvig, 244, b; Α.
2303 G. 2083 H. 384, 5.

⁵5. copiis opibus: ‘richeS, resourceS, prosperity ’ς the three
words differ very little in meaning. Plurimum posse ‘to be very influ-
ential ’. — cetera: proleptic. ¹

P. 22. — amicos: adversative asyndeton. —— ut ita dicam: Cic.
is apparently translating κτῆμα in such passages as Xen. Mem. 2, 4, 1
πάντων κτημάτων κράτιστον ἃν εἴη φίλος. For ut ita dream in a transla-
tion cf. n. on 49 redamare ‚· for the metaphor in supellex, Orat. 80 oratoria
quasi supellex ,· Sen. Ep. 58, 18 ideae, propria Platonis supellex ; Acad.
2, 31 and Sen. Ep. 2, 5, 8 vitae instrumentum. eius: A. 214, c;
G. 3653 H. 402, 403. — istorum:=istarum rerum. —vicit vi-
ribus: the alliteration is evidently intentional; cf. Mil. 30 vi vieta vis,
also Lael. 45. — sed haec hactenus: a common formula for wind·
ing up one subject and passing on to another; ‘but enough of this’.
So Fam. 6, 2, 3.

56. constituendi sunt etc.: for constituendum est ete. by atti-action
to the construction of the· clause qui sint etc. Cf. 63 perspiciuntur
quam sint leves; also n. on 3 5 deserere, and De Or. 2, 137 quaeruntur
qualia sint; ib. 2433 N. D. 2, 115. Madvig on Fin. 5, 58 says this
kind of attraction is used only by Cicero. — fines et quasi termini:
finis was very commonly used in the metaphorical sense, terminus less
commonly; hence the quasi. — diligendi: beware of taking this as
nom. pl. — video: See n. on 39 'vivemus ferri: ‘are usually
stated ’. Cf. 6 ferrebantur. — unam: this was an opinion which
the Epicureans managed to entertain. Though they based friendship
on utility (Diog. Laert. 10, 120) still they said that the full benefit of
friendship would not be reaped unless a man loved his friend just as
