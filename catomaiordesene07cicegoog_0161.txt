INTRODUCTloN. η

(2.) Philus. Several friends of Scipio are mentioned in
the dialogue. Chief of these is L. Furius Philus,¹ consul of the
year 136, a man of great knowledge and high character, and a
friend and patron of Greek literati. He is thought worthy by
Cicero to rank beside Cato and Laelius‚2 and is one of the inter·
locutors in the De Re Publica.

(3.) Rupilius. P. Rupilius ⁸ was consul in 132, and exercised
great severity against the partisans of Ti. Gracchus His consul-
ship is said to have been due to the aid of Scipio. He com-
manded in Sicily against the insurgent slaves and established a
code of laws sor the administration of that province.

(4.) Manilius. M’. (or Μ., the praenomen is uncertain)
ManiliuS,⁴ consul in 149, commanded in Africa for some time
against the Carthaginians with Scipio as one of his officers.
He was a very eminent lawyer, and a close friend of Laelius

and Scipio, appearing in the De Re Publica along with them.
(5.) Mummius. Spurius Mummius⁵ seems to have been a
very different man from his brother, the destroyer of Corinth.

He had both wit and literary ability, which recommended him to
the very intimate friendship of Scipio, with whom he is joined in
Cicero’s De Re Publica.⁶ When, to secure Scipio's safety‚ the
senate despatched him on an embassy to Asia, Mummius was his
companion. Mummius spent some time in Achaia as legatus to
his brother, and thence sent witty epistles in verse to his friends
at home.⁷ As a politician he was apparently unpopular and un-
successfu13 and devoting himself to study he became a strong
Stoic. We hear of him that. he was particularly noted for his
detestation of the teachers of Rhetoric.
