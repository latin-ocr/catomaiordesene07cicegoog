between the two (i. e. after integritas), in accordance with a fashion
exceedingly common in Cicero. Fides and integritas, loyalty and
uprightness, are cognate qualities‚ as are aequitas and liberalitas,
reasonableness (or fairness) and generosity. cf. Sest. 1 eos qui om-
nia divina et humana violarint vexarint perturbarint everterint, where
the words violarint vexarint go together and refer. to divina, while
the last two words refer to humana. Other examples will be found
in Mayor's n. on Phil. 2, 89. — cupiditas libido audacia: ‘pas-
sion, caprice, temerity’. Cic. generally (e. g. Tusc. 1, 20) translates
ἐπιθυμία by cupiditas or cupiditates. He always uses audacia in a bad
sense; cf. De Invent. 2, 165 audacia...vitium est. Its use in agood
sense is very rare in other authors. —- constantia: cf. n. on 8
constanti homini. — ut: = quales. naturam . . . ducem: cf. n.
on 17. The sentiment is an echo of Stoicism. The Stoics all said that

 

the true life was lit'e according to nature, but they were not agreed
as to the meaning of the word nature. Some took it to mean the
natural constitution of mam others the constitution of the universe,
from which by contemplation the wise man drew his rules of life.
With the words of Cicero here cf. Arch. 15 ego multos etc. — sic:
the adverb here takes the place of an object to perspicere, such as
tale aliquid. —- mihi perspicere videor: a modest way of saying
perspicio. ita: ‘under this condition’; so 1 ; Tusc. 3, 59 ea 'lege
nos esse natos ut... societas: this is the doctrine of Aristotle
ln his Politics (1, 1 φύσει ἄνθρωπος πολιτικὸν ζῷον), which Cicero
repeats and expands in many passages. Cf. especially Off. 1, 50
and 51, where the different grades of social union are set forth as
here; also Acad. ι, 213 Leg. 1, 23 and 61; Fin. 3, 66 and 5, 66. On
the doctrine that social and politica} organization is not the result
of agreement or invention, but has its origin in the essential elements'
of man's nature, see Woolsey‚ Political Science, Part 2, Ch. 2, es-
pecially § 7o. — ut . . . accederet ε sc. nobis, nos or ad nos (all three
constructions being found with proxime accedere in Cicero). Cf. off.
1, 50 optime societas hominum coniunctioque servabitur, si ut quisque
erit coniunctissimus, ita in eum benig-nitatis plurimum conferetur ,· also
for ut quisque cf. Verr. 4, 1433 Off. 1, 653 and below, 26, 29, 46.
— alieni: ‘strangers ’, whether of our own or of any other country.
Observe that alienus is never used in good Latin with the sense of
the English ‘alien '. —- natura ipsa: i. e. nature and nature onlyg
her efforts not having been seconded by those of men. Cf. Arch-
