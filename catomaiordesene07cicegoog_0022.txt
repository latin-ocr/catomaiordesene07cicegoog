mv INTRODUCTION.

of the year 195, to which he was elected in company with his
friend Flaccus, Cato was the first novus homo elected since
C. Flaminius, the consul of 217. It is probable, though not
certain, that he paved the way to his election by carrying the
first of the leges Porciae, restricting the right of punishing Ro-
man citizens, During the whole of his ‘career Cato showed a
high sense of the importance of the individual αἰνεῖς Romanus.

One of the first official acts of the new consul was to deliver
a set speech to the people against a proposal to repeal the Op-
pian law, passed twenty years before, the object of which was
to prevent lavish expenditure on dress and adornmentS, particu-
larly by women. We have a lively report of Cato's speech from
Livy’s pen, partly founded on the speech as published by Cato
himself-² The earnest pleading in favor of simple manners and
economy failed, after having almost caused an open insurrection
on the part of the women.2

The two new provinces in Spain, Hispania Citerior and Ulte-
rior, were still in a very unsettled state. The nearer province
was made a consular province and assigned to Cato ς the praetor
who governed the farther province was also placed under Cato’s
jurisdiction. Before leaving Rome Cato carried a law for pro·
tecting the provincials from extortion. During the whole of his
year of office he practised with the utmost exactness his princi-
ples οἱ purity, simplicity, and economy in public affairs· He is
said to have started from his house on the journey to Spain with
only three servants, but when he got as far as the forum, it struck
him that such an attendance was scarcely worthy of a Roman
consul, so he purchased two more slaves on the spot! In the
same spirit, before returning he sold his horse that the state
might not. be at the expense of transporting it to Italy. Cato
was no less careful of the revenue than of the expenditure. He
largely increased the productiveness of the mines and other
