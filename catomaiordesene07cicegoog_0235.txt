22 NOTES To LAELIUS. 67

of the verb nequire. — qui: see n. on C. M. 4, p. 3. — vita vitalis:
it is not known to what work oi Ennius the quotation belongs. The
words are an imitation of βίος amas. In his own style, Cic. would
have written vita potest esse ulla ‚· cf. 86 vitam esse nullam = βίον
εἶναι ἀβίωτον. quae conquiescit: ‘which does not find peace ’
in an interchange of kindness with a friend ’. Cf. Aristot. Eth. Nic.
9, 9, 3. quid dulcius: the omission of both enim and est gives
an abrupt emphasis to the question; so in 55, 30, 40, 25, .—
quicum: cf. n. on 2 quocum. For the sense oi this passage Seyf-
fert well compares Seneca de Tranquill. Animi c. 7 quantum bonum
est ubi sunt praeparata pectora in quae tuto secretum omne descendat,
quorum conscientiam minus quam tuam timeas, quorum sermo sollici·
tudinem lentat, sententia consilium expediat, hilaritas tristitram dissipet,
conspectus epse delectet. qui: lit. ‘ what sort of ἓ ⁸ Quis would
have meant merely ‘what?’ Tantus is here only a rhetorical vari·
ation for magnus, and as tantus implies quantus there is really an
ellipsis. For the context d. Aristot. Eth. Nic. 9, 9, 2. — fructus :
‘enjoyment’. ——act see A. 156. a; G. 646; H. 554, I. 2, n. ——
sine eo: takes the place of a conditional clause. See A. 3103 G.
594, 33 H. 507, 3, n. 7. ——quae expetuntur: ‘which are objects
of desire ⁹. Cic. commonly uses expetere, expetenda to represent the
Greek αἱρεῖν, αἱρετά, which are technical terms common to all the
later Greek philosophical schools. Anything which forms part of
the summum &num is αἱρετόν. Cf. 46 expetendas ,⁶ 80 expetita.
valetudot=here the bona v. of 203 cf. n. on 8. — amicitia: ad-
versative asyndeton. -— loco: perhaps abl. of separation with ex-
cluditur. Nullo loco may however have an adverbia] sense equivalent
to that of nusquam. The adverb praesto in the preceding clause
makes this probable, and the probability is increased by pluribus locis
below. A. 258, f; G. 385, Rem.; H. 425, 2. — ut aiunt: n. on 19.
Fire and water were fixed upon as the first necessaries of life in the
aqua et igni interdictio, which was equivalent to a sentence of exile.
Cf. Off. 1, 52 ex quo sunt illa communia (officia), non prohibere aqua
profluente, pati ab igne ignem capere si qui velit; Iustiniani Inst. 1,
16, ²3 Gaii Inst. 1, 161. — quae...prodest: a sidelong protest
against the theory (18) that only the σοφοί are capable of friendship.
delectat et prodest: so Hor. A. P. 333 aut prodesse volunt aut
delectare poetae. —vera et perfecta: ‘pure and faultless’3 the
τελείᾳ φιλία of Aristotle (Eth. Nic. 8, 6, 2) also ἦ ὡς ἀληθῶς mhi·
