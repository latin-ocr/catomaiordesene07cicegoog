33 NOTES To CATO MAIOR. [1

Flamininus drove the Macedonians into Thessaly. It is the shepherd
who in the first line addresses Flamininus by his first name Titus·
Cicero here cleverly applies the lines to his life-long friend Titus
Pomponius Atticus. He several times takes the two words ‘ 0 Tite'
to designate the whole treatise3 cf. Att. 16, 1 1, 3 ⁶ O Tite' tibi prodesse
laetor. —quidz accusative of respect or extent3 so nihil in 30, ali·
quid in 82. A.* 240, a; G. 331, 33 H. 378, 2. adiuero: for adit?-
vero, the long vowel having become short atter the falling out of the v
between the two voweIS. Catullus 66, 18 has inierint at the end of a
pentameter verse, and the same scanning is found in Plautus and Ter·
enee. A. 128, a; G. 151, 1 ; H. 235. —levassoz a form of levavero,

 

’ which was originally levaveso. For the formation of this class of

future-perfects see Peile, Introduction to Greek and Latin Etymology,
p. 295, ed. 33 also Roby, Gram. 1, p. 199, who has a list of examples3
he supports a different view from that given above; cf. A. 128, e, 33
G. 191, 53 H. 240, 4. coquit: ‘ vexes? This metaphorical use of

 

coquere occurs in poetry and late prose; cf. Plaut. Trin. 22 5 egomet me
coquo et macero et definge ,· Verg. Aen. 7, 345 quam . . .fimineae arden·
tem curaeque iraeque coquebant ,· Quint. 12, 10, 77 sollicitudo oratorem
macerat et coquit. versat: we have here the original quantity of
the vowel preserved, as in ponebat below, 103 the a in versat was
originally as long as the a in versis. Plautus has some parallels to
this scanning (see Corssen, Aussprache 112, 488), but it is rarely imi·
tated by poets of the best period. Horace, however, has arc'z’t, Odes
3, 16, 26. A. 375, g, 53 H. 580, 111. n. 2.—praemi: the genitive
in 212· from nouns in ium only began to come into us'e at the end of the
Republic. A. 40, b3 G. 29, Rem. 13 H. 51, 5.—isdem: Cicero
may have written tls-dem or eisdem (two syllables), but he probably did
not write the form most commonly found in our texts, iisdem. H. p. 74,
scot-note 2. Flamininum: T. Quinctius Flamininus first served
against Hannibal during the Second Punic War. He was present at
the capture of Tarentum in 209 Β. c., and in 208 was military tribune
under MarcelluS. After being employed on minor business of state,
he became quaestor in 199, and, immediately after his year οἱ office,
consul, passing over the aedileship and praetorship, and attaining the
consulship at the extraordinarily early age of 30. In 197 he won the
