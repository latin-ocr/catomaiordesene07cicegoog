70 N OTES To LAELIUS. [24

vaticinari sometimes means ‘ to prophesy ’, there may be a reference
to the fact that Empedocles claimed to possess prophetie and magic
powers. — totoque mundo: this is merely explanatory of rerum
namra, which has the same meaning3 ‘in the constitution of things
and the entire universe ’. — constarent...discordiam: Empedo-
cles held that two principles were perpetually at war in the universe,
one the principle of love or friendship, attraction, constantly .
tending to unite the scattered portions of the four elementS‚ fire,
air, earth, and water, so as to bring things into existence, the other
the principle of hate or enmity‚ repulsion, tending to decompose
bodies into their constituent parts. —- ea: object of both the in·
finitives following. -,- hoc: ‘this principle ', i. e. that friendship is
a uniting force, hatred a destructive force. — ornnes mortales:
here ὲ simply omnes homines. Cicero never uses mortalis for homo
without some attribute, though the usage is very common in Sallust,
TacituS, and the later Latin prose. Caesar altogether avoids the
word. Cf. mortalis nemo in 18. — re probant: ‘approve by their
actions ’. —- siquando aliquod: Cicero, like the other Latin
writers, often seems capricious in his use of quando and aliquando,
quid (quod ...) and aliquid (aliquod ...) atter si. It is commonly said
that when the words with ali- are used aster si they are more ern-
phatic than the simple forms; the passages, however, do not always
bear out the supposition. cf. Madvig, 493, a, *Obs. 1. — adeun-
dis: i. e. pro amico ; in the one case the amicus meets the danger
alone, and protects his friend; in the other both friends face it
together. The use of in is the same as that in 9 in pueris. —
M. Pacuvi: Pacuvius, the greatest tragic writer in Latin (summus
tragicus—Cic. de Opt. Gen. Dic. 2) was born at Brundisium about
220 and lived till about 130 Β. c. See Sellar, Roman Poets of the Re-
public, Ch. 5. Since Pacuvius probably exhibited no new play after
his eightieth year (Cic. Brut. 229), and Scipio died in 1²9 13.c., the
word nuper is very loosely used, as in 13. Pacuvius probably never
became a Roman citizen, hence Cic. calls him hospes as well as ami·
cus. So Fam. 9, 12, 2 hospiti veteri et amico (οἱ king Deiotarus).
¹nova fabula: commonly supposed to be a play called the Du·
lorestes (though Ribbeck and some other scholars deny this), of
which a number of fragments are preserved. Cf. Fin. 5, 63. The
story was often handled by Greek dramatists. The plays of Pacu·
vius were all palliatae and closely copied from Greek originals, but it
