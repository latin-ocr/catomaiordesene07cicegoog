of the vines, an interpetation which is quite possible. Those editors
are certainly wrong who remove the comma after tugatzb and place it
after religatio, as though et were omitted between the two words. In
enumerations of more than two things Cic. either omits the copula
altogether or inserts it before each word after the first; but in enumer-
ating two things et cannot be omitted, except where there are several
sets or pairs of things. Cf. n. on 13. — religatio: i. e. the tying
down of shoots so as to cause them to take root in the earth. Reltjga-
tio seems to occur only here.

P. 28. - aliorum immissio: ‘ the granting of free scope to others ’.

, smmis-sio scarcely occurs elsewhere in good Latin. The metaphor is

from letting loose the reins in driving: cf. Verg. Georg. 2, 3643 Plin.
N. H. 16, 141 cupressus immittitur in perticas asseresque amputatione
ramorum ‚· Varro, R. R. 1, 31, 1 vitzs immittitur ad uvas pariendas.
Some, referring to Columella de Arbor. c. 7, take the word to mean
the setting in the earth of a shoot in order that it may take root before
being separated from the parent stem. The context, however, is
against this interpretation. — irrigationes etc. : the plurals denote
more prominently than singulars would the repetition of the actions

 

expressed by these words. repastinationes: ⁸ repeated hoeings ’.
The pastinum was a kind of pitchfork, used for turning over the ground
round about the vines, particularly when the young plants were being
put in. — multo terra fecundior: see n. on 3 parum . . . auctoretatzs.

54. ,in eo libro: see Introd. -— doctus: often used of poets, not
only by Cicero but by most other Latin writerS, more particularly by
the elegiae poets3 see also n. on 13. — Hesiodus: the oldest Greek

poet after Homer. The poem referred to here is the Ἔργα καὶ Ἡμέραι.
which we still possess, along with the Theogony and the Shield of
Heracles. -- eum: concessive. — saeculis: ‘generations ’, as in
24. -- fuit z =v22xit. -- Laerten: the passage referred to is no
doubt the touching scene in Odyss. 24, 226, where Odysseus, after kill-
ing the suitorS, finds his unhappy old father toiling in his garden. In
that passage nothing is said of manuring. lenientem ε see n. on
11 dmaentet colentem etc.: the introduction of another parti·
ciple to explain lenientem is far from elegant. Cultt'one agri or some·
thing of the kind might have been expected. The collocation of
appetentem with occupatum in 56 is no less awkward. — facit: n.
on 3 facimus. res rusticae laetae sunt: ‘the farmer’s life ia
gladdened ’. — apium: this form is oftener found in the best MSS..
