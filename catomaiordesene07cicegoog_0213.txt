4] NOTEs To LAELIUS. · 45

Wordsworth, Fragments and Specimens of Early Latin, Ch. 2, 43 also
Peile, Introd. to Gk. and Lat. Etymology, p. 336 (ed. 3). ——— Afri-
cani: see Introd. p. iv. -- sententias: ‘the opinions expressed in
the discussion ', i. e. their purport‚ not the actual words. exposui
arbitratu tneo: ‘ have rendered at my own discretion ’. Like very
many other nouns whose stems end in -ιι, arbitratus scarcely appears
except in the ablative singular. The other cases of the sing. are sup·

 

plied by the corresponding cases of arbitrium. and even in the abla-
tive arbitrio is commoner than arbitratu. — quasi. .. loquentis: ‘ 1
have exhibited them as speaking in person, if I may say so ’. Quasi
modifies the too strong expression zpsou cf. 27, 55, 6. On loquentis see
A. 292, ες G. 5363 H. 535, Ι. 4. A modern writer would hardly have
thought it necessary to indicate that the interlocutors cannot actually
appear in person. — ne ‘ inquam ’ etc.= this is directly and closely
imitated from the introduction to Plato’s TheaetetuS,'p. 142, a dia-
logue Cic. imitates elsewhere, as in De Or. 3, 473 Tusc. 1, 8. -- ’
coram: adverb here, as it is generally throughout the Republican
and Augustan Latin. The prepositional use occurs in two passages
of Cicer0, Pis. 12 mihi vero eps-i coram genero meo quae dicere ausus
es, and Fam. 13, 6 A, 1, and in one or two of Nepos; but Tacitus is
the only writer who uses the word freely as a preposition.

4. ‘curn enirn ete.= the triple repetition of cum in this sentence
seems careless and inelegant, but passages of the sort are not uncom·
mon in Cic. — mecum ageres : ‘ pleaded with me ’ς so tecum agere

 

in 163 agere cum populo in 96. scriberem aliquid: so C. M. 2
cum de senectute vellem aliquid scribere. feci . . . ut prodessem t a

 

roundabout way of saying profui. The constr. is a favorite one with ·

Cic.; cf. Vat. 21 invitus facio ut recorder ,· cf. C. M. 42 invitus feci and
n. Cic. often gives as his reason for writing the desire to serve his
countrymen; so Acad. 1, 11 ς Div. 2, 53 Off. 2, 2. — Catone maiore ε
see Intr. to C. M. p. ix. —- qui est . . ‚senectutez which 1 dedicated
to you...; cf. C. M. 3; Fin. 1‚8; Div. 2, 33 Att. 8, 12, 6 Demetri Mag-
netis librum quem ad te misit de concordia. For the collocation of the
words cf. Tusc. 4, 66 eam rationem quae...malis; also De Or. 2, 61
Ιῶνί qui sunt fere inscripti de. -— induxi. . . persona: both words
are connected with the stage. . Inducere is literally ‘to bring upon
the boards’ (cf. 59) z persona properly means a mask‚ here ‘a type ot
character ’ as we say. See n. on C. M. 3 facimus admirantis ,· also
cf. Eael. 03, roo, and tor the general sense of the passage Att. 13, 19,
