94 noras To LAELmS. [59

 

⁵9. ae ipse: ιι. on 5 te epse. quibusdam: the persons here
meant are the ‘ small-souled men' (μικρόψυχοι) described bv Aristot.
Eth. Nic. 4, 3, 35. — eumz=talem virum. — ille: referring to
the same person to which eum refers. Had ille been left out the sub-
ject of est might have been taken to be amicus supplied from amici in
the preceding clause. It was necessary therefore to insert a pronoun,
and according to Latin usage the change from eum to ille was needed;
to repeat is would have been unusual. The following examples are
precisely similar: Sest. 7 et ad eum filiam eius adduxit, ut ille
aliquam partem maeroris sui deponeret ‚· Prov. Cons. 1 quonam me
ane‘mo in eos esse oportet, cuim illi salutem pro pegnore tradiderunt.
So am, and ἐκεῖνος often refer (in the same sentence) to the same
person; e. g. Plato, Phaedo 111 B τὰς δὲ ὥρας αὐτοῖς κρᾶσιν ἔχειν
τοιαύτην ὅστε ἐκείνους ἀνόσους εἶναι. ’ inducat spem: cf. n. on 4
induxi. vocem: see n. on C. M. 27 vox. inimiciorem ami-
citiae: oxymoron3 see ιι. on 23 absentes adsunt. — esset osurus:
the subject of the verb is the same as the unexpressed subject of the
infinitive amare ,· cf. 623 82 apsum. —— adduci: by a common idiom,
a positive verb (dicebat) must be supplied from negabat above. —
putaretur: se. dictam esse. — Biante: the saying is ascribed to
Bias of Priene by Aristotle Rhet. 2, 13, ²3 (whence Cic.. who knew
the Rhetoric well, probably took it) and Diog. Laert. 1, 87, but to
Chilon, another of the Seven, by Gellius, Noct Att. 1, 3, 30. The
sentiment was put by Sophocles into the mouth of Ajax (see nn.
on 45), and is repeated by Demosth. Aristoc. p. 660. — septem:
n. on 7. — impuri: adversative asyndeton. ——omnia...revo·
cantis: cf. 32 ad voluptatem omma referunt. —- amicus...ei: n.
on 39 AemiIIum Luscino. peccet: n. on 37 peccati. —sibiz
the person meant is the same as the unexpressed subject of the infini-
tives cupere and optare. it is rather remarkable to find sibi following
immediately on a verb the subject of which is a different person. —-
tamquam: qualifies the metaphor in ansas. ansas ad: the usual
construction is ansam dare. or praebere alicuius rei. ad reprehen-
dendum: ‘for criticism ’ς it is possible howeveg that reprehendendum
has here the literal sense ‘to catch hold of ’ as in Acad. 2, 139 revocat
virtus vel potius reprehendit manu.

60. comparandis: so Fin. 1, 66 amicitias comparare. ut ne:
n. on 42 ne. —— minus felices: euphemism for infelices ,·· so mimo
iustae in 613 nec facillime in 99. — ferendum: Diog. Laert. 1, 60
