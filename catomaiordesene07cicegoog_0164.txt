viii INTRoDUc‘rION.

The wit as well as the learning of Scaevola was renowned,¹
and he was noted for sweetness and affability of demeanor.²
Cicero, who was in early life, along with Atticus, placed under
his guardianship‚ always speaks of him with great affection and
admiration. Scaevola appears also as one of the interlocutors in
the De Oratore and in the De Re Publica.

(3.) Fannius. Gaius Fannius served with distinction under
Scipio in the Third Punic War. He and Tiberius Gracchus ’
were the first to mount the walls of Carthago when it was
stormed. He served again in Spain, but seems to have been
unsuccessful in political life. He was a man of considerable
cultivation and literary activity‚ and wrote a history, the style of
which is very faintly praised by Cicero though its accuracy was
highly estimated by Sallust. His character seems to have been
somewhat severe.⁸ He appears with Scipio and Laelius and
Scaevola as one of the interlocutors in the De Re Publica
