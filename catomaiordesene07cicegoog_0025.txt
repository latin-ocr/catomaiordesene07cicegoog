INTRODUCTION. xvii

lngs against the Scipios seem to have begun in 187 and not to
have been completed before 18 5.

N early twenty years had passed since the conflict between
Cato and Scipio began, and now it had ended in a complete
triumph for Cato.² But the new modes of which Scipio was the
chief patron were too strong to be conquered, and Cato spent
the rest of his life in fighting a hopeless battle against them,
though he fought for a time with the strongest weapons that the
constitution supplied. In 184 he was censor along with Flaccus,
who seems to have allowed his colleague full liberty of action.
Every portion of the censor’s duty was carried out on the most
severe and ‘old Roman' principles, Seven senators were de-
graded‚ among them L. Flamininus, an ex-consul and brother of
the ‘ liberator of the Hellenes,' for serious misconduct,² also
Manilius, an ezr-praetor, tor no worse offence than that of
having kissed his wife in presence of his daughter. M. Furius
Purpurio, who had actually competed with Cato for the censor·
ship‚ was punished for diverting a public aqueduct for his private
advantage. Flaccus was named leader of the senate in the place
of Scipio AfricanuS, now dead.

On reviewing the equites, Cato removed from that body Ι..
Scipio and many others on various charges ε this one had allowed
himself to grow too fat for horsemanship3 that had failed to
groom his horse properly3 another had neglected his farm; an-
other again had made an untimely jest on the occasion of the
review itself. With the ordinary citizens Cato dealt just as
harshly. In his censorian edict he sharply reproved the ex-
travagance prevalent at private feasts. All articles of luxury,
such as slaves purchased at fancy prices, luxurious clothing,
carriages, statueS, and pictures were rendered liable to heavy
taxation. In this way Cato revenged himself for the repeal of
the Oppian law.
