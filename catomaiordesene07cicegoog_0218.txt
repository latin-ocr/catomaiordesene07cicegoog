50 NOTES TO LAELIUS. [7

had been enjoined on him by the Delphian god ocal ἐκ μαντείων καὶ
ἐξ ἐνυπνίων. The Scholiast on Aristophanes’ Nubes 1¹4 gives there
the actual words of the answer to Chaerephon: σοφὸς Σοφοκλῆς,
σοφώτερος δ’ Εὐριπίδης, ἀνδρῶν δ’ ἁπάντων Σωκράτης troph-repas. The
latter of thetwo lines is also preserved by Diogenes Laertius 2, 5,
ᾖ 37. Cic. speaks in four other passages of the oracle, viz. Lael. 10
and 13, Cat. M. 78, Academ. 1, 16. — omnia...esse: the Stoic
doctrine is here hinted at, that virtue is the only thing deserving the
name of good, and that the happiness of the truly wise man is ab·
solutely unaffected by external circumstances. People were curious
to see whether Laelius would try to carry out his philosophy, and
to appear careless about the death of his friend. Cf. n. on C. M. 4
qui... petunt —— virtute inferiores: ‘ot less importance than vir-
tue ’. This (see preceding n.) is not strong enough to express the
Stoic doctrine. — credo: merely parenthetic, and without ''influ-
ence on the construction. The verb to be supplied for this clause
is quaerunt, not quaerere. hoc: ‘our friend here’3 so 32. «-
quonam³ pacto: lit. ‘ on what conditions ’, pactum (pacis-Por) being
properly something agreed on between two persons. The phrase
came to be used in exactly the same sense as quonam modo ,· cf. 4
nescio quo pacto with 89 nescio quo modo. eoque magis: sc. ο
quaerunt. The sentence from quod onwards is explanatory oi eo,
which is the ablative of excess dependent on magis. — proximis ε
‘the last ’. Proximus is used both of the future and of the past. Oc-
casionally a word is inserted to define the meaning more nearly, as
Fam. 1, 9, 20 proximis superioribus diebus ‚· Tac. A. 1, 77 'proximo
priore anno, and also when proximus is used of space, as Cic. Orat.
216 proximum superiorem pedem ,· N. D. 2, 53 proximum inferiorem
orbem. Bruti: D. Iunius-Brutus, surnamed Gallaecus from his
conquest oi the Gallaeci, consul in 138 13.c. He appears, as augur
only in our passage. — commentandi causa: ‘with a view to
practice ⁹, i. e. in the augural art. Commentari is properly ‘to con
over a lesson’, μελετᾶν. For the custom cf. Cic. Div. 1, 90 divi-
nant Magi qui congregantur t'n fano commentandi causa atque inter se
colloquendi, quod etiam idem vos quondam facere Nonis solebatis. As
the augurs required for their practice an open space whence they
could get an uninterrupted view of the sky they usually met in some
- gentleman’s park (horti) outside the city: cf. N. D. 2, 11. — qui
...solitus esses: ‘though you had been accustomed’. For this
