and the circumstances of the supposed conversation (3).

Introductory conversation . . . . ' ..... 4-9.

Scipio declares his admiration of Cato's vigorous and happy
old age. Cato replies that the secret lies in following the
guidance of Nature (4, 5). Laelius then asks Cato to point out
the road to such an old age as his own (6). This the old man
promises to do, but first remarks that the faults charged against
old age are generally due to defects of character (7). Laelius
suggests that prosperity makes Cato’s declining years pleasant.
Cato admits that there may be some truth in this, but main-
tains that right character alone can make old age tolerable (8, 9).
