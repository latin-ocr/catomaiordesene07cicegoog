had borne the title had waited for the public to confer it on thern (Fin.
2, 7). — eumque: ‘and yet he'3 cf. n. on ¹3 vixitque. — ia-
ceremus: for the tense cf. n. on 42 efficerem also expeteretur below.
— ad .. . referenda: ‘ ought to be judged by the standard of pleas-
ure ’‚ i. e. anything which brings pleasure ‘may be regarded as good,
and its opposite bad. So in Greek ἐπαναφέρων τὶ εἵς τι. On the
moral teachings of Epicurus consult Zener‚ Stoics‚ Epicureans, and
Sceptics‚ Ch. 193 Ueberweg‚ History of Philosophy, ᾖ 59; Guyan‚ La
morale d'Epicure et ses rapports avec les doctrines contemporaines.
— Curium Coruncanium: see n. on 15· — id persua-

· deretur: intransitive verbs are used in the passive only impersonally

(Roby‚ 1422; A. 23o; G. 199, Rem. ις Η. 301, 1); when so used the
dative may follow as in the active (see Madvig, 244, b; G. 208; H.
384, 5). A neuter pronoun in the singular sometimeS, as here, accom-
panies the passive, and may be regarded as an adverbial accusative os
respect or extent, or as a nominative qualisying the impersonal subject.
The former is probably the real construction. Cf. Roby, 1423, and
Madvig, 229, b, Obs. 1. — Samnitibus: then in alliance with Pyr-
rhus. -— vixerat . . . cum ε not to be taken literally of living in the
same house, the phrase merely indicates close friendship. In Acad.
2, 1 15 Cic. writes Diodoto qui mecum vivit tot annos, qui habitat apud
me, clearly showing that the phrases vivere cum aliquo and habitare apud
aliquem are not equivalent. — Ρ. Decio: this is P. Decius Mus, who
at the battle of Sentinum in ²9 5 gave his life asa propitiatory offering
to the powers of the unseen world, in order to bring victory to the
Roman arms. His father had sacrificed himself in the same way at the
battle of Veseris (close to Vesuvius) in 340, fought against the Latins
and Campanians. devoverat: Liv. 10, 28, 13 (speech of Decius)

iam ego mecum hostium legiones mactandas Telluri et dis Mani·
bus dabo. aliquid etc.: ‘some principle’; in his philosophica]
works Cicero often confounds the Epicureans by quoting the action of
the Decii and others like it, as showing that pleasure is not the end
of existence. Cf. especially Fin. 2, 61 P. Decius cum se devoverat et
equo admisso in mediam aciem Latinorum irruebat, aliquid de voluptati-
bus suis cogitabat? Cf. also below, 7 5. With regard to natura see n.
on 5. sua sponte= ‘for its own sake'; ‘on its own account ’.
Cf. Leg. 1, 45 vera et salsa sua sponte non aliena induantur, where a
few lines later sua natura occurs as equivalent to sua sponte —- exe
