⁵1. mihi-..videntum see Introd. -babent rationem cum:
‘they have their reckonings with ’, ‘their dealings with’3 a phrase
of book-keeping. -— imperium: so Verg. Georg. 1, 99 exercetque

frequens tellurem atque imperat agria ib. 2, 369 dura exerce '

imperia et ramos compesce fluentes ,- Tac. Germ. 26 sola terme seges im·
per-atur. — sed alias . .. faenore: put for sed smper cum faenore,
alim minore, plerumque manbre. — vis ac natura: ⁸ powers and con
stitution ⁸. These two words are very often used by Cic. together, as
in Fin. ι, 5ο vis ac natura rer-rem. — gremio: so Lucret. r, 2 5ο
pereunt imbres ubi eos pater aether In gremium matra: terrai praecapita-
vit, imitated by Verg. Georg. 2, 325. — mollito ac subacto: i. e.
by the plough. Subzssgm, ‘subdue ², is a technical word of agriculture:
so Verg. Georg. 2, 50 scrobibus subactis ,⁰ see also below, 59.

P. 22.-occaecatum: ‘hiddent Caecus has the sense of ‘un-
seen’ as well as that of ‘unseeing ⁹ or ‘blind '’. -—- occatio: Cicero’s
derivation, as well as Varro’s (De Re Rust. 1, 31, 1) from occidere, be·
cause the earth is cut up, is unsound. Occa is rastrum, probably from
its sharp points (root affl: occatio therefore is ⁶ harrowing '. —- va-
pore: ‘heat’. This word has not in the best Latin the meaning of
our ‘ vapor ’. —— compressu: a word found only here in Cicero’s
writings and elsewhere in Latin only in the ablative case, like so many
other nouns whose stem ends in ·u. — diffundit et elicit: ‘expande
and lures forth ⁹. — herbescentem: this word occurs nowhere else
in Latin. -- nixa: A. 254, b3 G. 403‚ Rem. 33 H. 425, 1, 1),n. -—
fibris stirpium: so Tusc. 3, 13 radicum fibras. -— geniculato :
‘knotted ’. The verb gent‘culm from genu, scarcely occurs excepting
in the passive participle, which is always used, as here, of plants. So
Plin. Nat. Hist. 16, 158 geniculata cetera gracilitas nodisque disn'ncta,
spici: besides spica, the forms spana
and spebus are occasionally found. Spici here is explanatory offingem.
-— vallo: for the metaphor compare N. D. 2, 143 munitae sunt pal·
pebrac tamquam vallo pilorum ,· Lucr. 2, 537.

⁵2. quid ego commemorem: this and similar formulae for
passing to a new subject are common: cf. 53 quid egv . . . prqferam etc.;
often nam precedes the quid, as in Lael. 104. The egv has a slight
emphasis. Cato implies that his own devotion to grape-culture was so
well known as not to need description. — ortus satus incrementa:
⁸ origin, cultivation, and growth ’. For the omission of the copula see
