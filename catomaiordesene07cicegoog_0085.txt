 

7] NOTES To CATO MAIOR. 49

spondeam ; Lael. 32 tu vero perge ,- pro hoc enim respondeo. A. 317, c,
H. 499, 2, n. ——senes fieri: if the infinitive had depended on spera·
mus alone and volumus had not intervened, Cicero would probably
have written nosficturos esse senes. multo ante: sc. quam id fac·
tum erit: so Balb. 41 re denique multo ante (sc. quamsactum est) audita,
and very often in Cicero. — didicerimus: as this corresponds with
fecerat, it would have been formally correct to write here nos documlv.

 

— quibus . . . possimus: ‘what considerations will enable us most -

easily to support the growing burden of age ⁹. — futurum est =-·-
μέλλει eluat: this form of the future is used in preference to the simple
erit because it is desired to represent the event as on the very point of
fulfilment, and therefore sure of fulfilnient. Erit would have implied
much less certainty. Trans. ‘ 1 will do se, if my action is going to give
you pleasure'. Cf. 67 beatus futurus sum ‚· also 81, 8 5. See Roby,
1494. -— nisi molestum est: a common expression of courtesy,
like 15 nisi alienum putas, si placet ; cs. Hor. Sat. 2, 8, 4 si grave non est.
-- tamquam longam viam: Cicero here puts into Laelius’ mouth

almost the very words addressed by Socrates to the aged Cephalus in
the introduction to Plato’s Republic, 328 E. Observe the succession

of similar sounds in tamquam, aliquam, longam, viam. viam
confeceris: so pro Quint. 79 conficere Dec milia passuum ‚· conficere
iter is a common phrase. For mood see A. 3123 G. 6043 H. 513, ΙΙ.
——quam ...ingrediundum sit: this construction, the neuter oi ,
the gerundive with est followed by an accusative case, is exceedingly
rare excepting in two writers, Lucretius and Varro. See the full list
of examples given by Roby, Gram., Pref. to vol. 2, p. Lxxn. A. 294,
c; Η. 371, Ι. 2, 2), n. The best texts of Cicero now give only one
example of a construction at all resembling this, viz. pro Scauro 13
obliviscendum vobis putatis matrum in liberos, virorum in uxores scelera?
The supposition of some scholarS, that in this passage Cic. used the
construction in imitation of the archaic style of Cat0, is not likely to
be true, seeing that in Cato's extant works the construction does not
once occur. ‘For the form -undum see n. on 5 ferundum. —- istuc:
not adverb, but neuter pronoun, as in 8. The kind of construction,
istuc videre quale sit for videre quale istuc sit, is especially common in
Cicero.

7. faciam ut potero: ‘I will do it as well as 1 can’. Observe
the future potero where English idiom would require a present. So
Rep. 1, 38 hic Scipio, faciam quod voltis, ut potero. saepe enim:
