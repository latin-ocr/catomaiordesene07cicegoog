is not exactly known on what Greek play the Dulorestes was founded.
It certainly did not* follow the Iphigenia in Tauris οἱ Euripides,
which treats the same story. The rex was Thoas, king of the Tauric
Chersonese. — stantes plaudebant: ‘they (the audience) rose to
their feet and cheered'. It has generally been supposed that Cic.
here is guilty of a slight anachronism‚ because the first permanent
theatre at Rome was erected by PompeiuS, before which time it is
believed that the audience stood throughout the exhibition of the
plays. The temporary booths‚ however, may have contained rough
galleries; cf. Tac. Ann. 14, 2ο with Nipperdey’s n. With Cicero’s
words cf. Att. 2, 19, 3 Curioni stantes plauserant,· Phaedr. 5, 7, 28
in plausus consurrectum est ,· Suet. Aug. 56. On the use of stantes
see G. 667, Rem. ις H. 549, 5. arbitramur: n. on ¹4 censemus.

—— possent: sc. si sacto opus esset. For suppressed protasis cf. ref.
on 5 velim.

past tense to suit the tense of potuisse. —- ab eis: cf. ¹7-

25. nos autern: sc. quaeremus. It very seldom happens in Latin
that a verb in the indicative or subjunctive, or indeed a verb at all,
has to be supplied from one in the imperative or vice versa.
saepe quaesivi: sc. quid sentirent. —- filum: all languages have
metaphors resembling this. cf. De Or. 3, 103 filo apso et genere ora·

but in the dialogue De Re Publica 1, 18 Fannius appears as one of
the listeners. He may not have been represented as present at the
discussions in the subsequent books, which are only preserved in a
fragmentary state. In 14 Cic. seems to indicate the absence of Fan·
