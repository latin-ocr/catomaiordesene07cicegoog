73] NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. 111

more usual si sm — accedam ε see A. 3423 G. 6663 H. 5²9· II.
— in portum: speaking of death, Cic. says in Tusc. 1, 118 portum
potius paratum nobis et perficgium putemus .· quo utinam velis passis per·
vehi liceat! Sin reflantibus vente& reeciemur tamen eodem paulo tardius
referamur necesse est ,· cf. also ib. 1, 107.

P. 80. —72 munus offici: see n. on 29· — tueri: ‘uphold’.
— possit: subject indefinite. — ex quo fit etc.: the argument
seems to be that youth knows how long it has to last and is therefore
less spirited than age, which knows not when it will end. ani·
mosior .. . fortior: Horace, Odes 2, 10, 21 rebus ang-ustie animosus
atque sortis appare ; the two words are joined also in Cic. Mil. 92: ani-
mosus, ‘spirited '. — hoc illud est etc.: ‘ this is the meaning of the
answer made by Solon etc ¹. Cf. Div. 1, 122 hoc nimirum illud est
quod de Socrate accepimus, also the Greek phrase ἥ τοῦτ’ ἐκεῖνο. Est==
valet as iu 69. Pisistratus: the despot of Athens, who seized the
power in 560 Β. c. Plutarch, who tells the story, ‘An Seni Sit Ge·
renda Respublica’ c. 21, makes Solon speak to the friends of Pisistra·
tuS, not to P. himself. —- quaerenti: see n. on 11 dividenti. ——
audaciter: Quintil. 1, 6, 17 condemns those who used audaciter for
audacter, which latter torm, he sayS‚ had been used by ‘ all orators ⁹.
Yet the form audaciter is pretty well attested by MSS. 'here and else·
where in Cicero. [See Neue, Formenlehre, 1² 662.] For the two
forms cf. dffciliter, difficulter. Audaciter is of importance as showing
that c before i must have been pronounced just like c in any other po·
sition, not as in modern Italian. -— certis sensibus: Acad. 2, 19
integris incorruptisque sensibus. ipsa . . . quae: see n. on 26. H.
569, 1. 2. — coagmentavit: Cic. is fond of such metaphors; cf.
Orat. 77 verba verbis quasi coagmentari ,· Phil. 7, 21 docebo ne coagmen-
tari quidem pacem posse (ξ that no patched-up peace can be made ').
-— conglutinavit ε a still more favorite metaphor than coagmentare.
Cic. has conglutinare rem (Or. 1, 188); amicitias (Lael. 32 and Att. 7,
8, 1); voluntates (Fam. 11, 27, 2); concordiam (Att. 1, 17, 1o); in Phil.
3, 28 Cic. says ot' Antony that he is totus ex vitiis· conglutinam. —
iam : ‘further '3 so below. — conglutinatio: the noun occurs only
here and Orat. 78 c. verborum. -— reliquum: not infrequently, as
here, used substantively with an adjective modifier. -- sine causa:
‘without sufficient reason '.
