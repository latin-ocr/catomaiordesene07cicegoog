40 NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. [1

almost entirely poetical, Sallust being the only prose writer of the best
period in whose works the usage is beyond doubt. Noctes is put before
dies here, as in noctes diesque (Verr. 5, 112), noctes et dies (Brut. 308
eta), noctesac dies (Arch. 29); cf. also Verg. Aen. 6, 1273 and νύκτας τε
καὶ ἦμαρ in Iliad 5, 4903 but the collocations dies noctesque, dies et noctes
are far commoner in Cicero. Madvig (Emend. Liv. p. 487 n., ed. 2)
says that in writers of Livy’s time and earlier, when an action is men-
tioned which continues throughout a number of days and nightS, either
dies et noctes and the like phrases are used, or die et nocte and the like3
but not diem noctemque or diem et noctem, which expression, he says,
would imply that the action continued only throughout one day and
one night. But Madvig has overlooked De Or. 2, 162 eandem incu-
dem diem noctemque tundentibus ,· also three passages of Caesar: viz.
Bell. Gall. 7, 42, 6 and 7, 77, 113 Bell. Civ. 1, 62, 13 to which add a
passage in the Bell. Hisp. 38. Though diem noctemque does often
mean ‘throughout one day and one night' (as e. g. in Nep. Them. 8, 7),
yet it would seem that the other sense cannot be excluded.·-- mode-
rationem . . ‚aequitatem ε ‘the sels-control and even balance of your
mind '. Moderatio is in Cic. a common translation of σωφροσύνη.
Aequitas is not used here in its commonest sense of ‘reasonableness ’
or ‘ equity ’, but as the noun corresponding to aequus in the ordinary
phrase aequus animus (Horace, ‘aequam memento rebus in arduis ser-
vare mentem ’); cf. Tusc. 1, 97 hanc maximi animi aequitatem in ipsa
morte, said of Theramenes' undisturbed composure before his execu-
tion. — animi tui: for the position of these words between modera-
tzonem and aequitatem, to both of which nouns they refer (a form of
speech called by the Latin grammarians coniunctio), see note on Lae-
lius 8 cum summi viri tum amicissimi. cognomen: i. e. the name
Atticus, which Cicero’s friend did not inherit, but adopted. For the
word cognomen cf. n. on 5. ——deportassez it should be noted that
the verb deportare is nearly always in the best writers used of bring·
ing things from the provinces to Italy or Rome, and not vice versa,
the Romans using ‘down ’ (de) of motion towards the capital. Italia
deportare occurs in Tacitus and late writerS, but only in the sense of
banishing a person (cf. Anu. 14, 45). So decedere de provincia is com·
mon, but not Roma decedere. As to the form deportasse, it may be
remarked that Cic. in the vast majority of instances uses the con·
tracted and not the full forms of the infinitives corresponding to per·
fects in -avi. So putassent in 4- An extensive collection of examples
