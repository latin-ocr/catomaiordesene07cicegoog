88 ¹ Not-Es To LAELms. [48.-

quan augur qni capiendus est ex virtutibus valet ut etc. The non be·
fore plus would not be required by good English idiom, though in
vulgar English ‘ not . .. no rnore than ’ is common for ‘not . . . any more
than ⁹. — contrahat: the subject is probably quis indefinite, omit-
ted as in De Or. 1, 30 quo velit= quo quis velit. It may be, however,
as Seyffert and Nauck make it, the whole clause si.. ,eluceat The
subjunctive is causal. — supra: an expression inadvertently used
by Cic„ for it implies writing and is inapplicable to a speech. Cf.
however 15. In 8 we have ut est a Fannio dmum. — id curn con-
tigit: cum here simply = quotiens. On contigit see n. on 8. For cum
with perfect tense cf. 94.

P. 20.—49. aedificio: see n. on C. M. 56 porco etc. — cor-
poris... animante: adversative asyndeton. — praedito: as ani-
mans is exceptionally used of man it is here made masculine, but
when it is applied to the lower animals‚ as in 81, it is generally femi-
nine. — redamare: coined by Cic. here to express ἀντιφιλεῖν and
used by him nowhere elset it does not occur again in Latin literature
till very late. Ut ita dicam is used to soften the harshness of this
new word. — remuneratione: this applies to redamare only, while
vicissitudine applies to both amare and redamare.

⁵0. quid? This little anticipatory question, like τί δέ in Greek,
serves to draw special attention to what follows. Its meaning really
is ‘ What do you think of this that Ι am going to say?’
mus: n. on fiagimus, 47. -— nihil esse etc.: it will be seen that the

 

comparison is not quite perfect, there being two members in the first
branch (nihil. . . rem ullam) and three in the second (amicitiam . . .
[homines] . . .similitudo). —- similitudo: properly this should be
similitudinem in the same construction as nihil, but it is attracted into
the same case with quod. Such attractions of case are common. —
verum esse ut: cf. 14 sin autem illa veriora ut,· also 81 apparet. . . ut ;
68 spem afferunt ut. When the clause after verum est is an infinitive
clause, it is regarded as embodying a fact, when an itt-clause, a conse·
quence or result. The meaning here may be represented thus: ‘this
result will be granted as true, so as to lead to the fact that the good
love the good ’. quasi propinquitate: ‘a sort of relationship’;
opposed to actual propinquitas (19). —— natura: ‘natural affinity’.
appetentius: when present participles lose the notion of time and
become adjectives they may take a genitive case. — similium: the
neuter plural of the adjective in the genitive case used as substantive
