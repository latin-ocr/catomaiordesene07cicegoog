82 NOTES TO LAELIUS. . [39.

the agrarian law. He was tribune in ¹3¹ Β. e. and introduced vote
by ballot at the passing of laws in the Comitia. As consul in 120
he tried to reconcile himself with the aristocrats but failed. In 119
he was prosecuted tor his share in the Gracchan troubles and corn·
mitted suicide. — Cato: a grandson of the censor, and also of
Paulus Macedonicus, whose daughter married the son os the censor.
This Cato was consul·in 114 and condemned for corruption in con-
nection with Iugurtha. — minime: qualifies acer to be supplied
from accerrimus, ‘then not very zealouS, though now exceedingly so ⁹.
Tum refers to the period immediately after the death of Ti. Grac·
chus ς nunc, to the time of the supposed conversation, 1²9 Re. In
the word acerrimus there is a hint at· the suspicion that C. Gracchus
had a hand in Scipio’s death. See Intr. to C. M. p. xxii. This diffi-
’ cult passage is thoroughly discussed by Madvig, Opuscula‚ 2, 281. —-
Gaius: see n. on 3.

40. neque...nec: common in Cic. for nec...nec‚· nec...neque,
however, is rare (Arch. 29). Cf. 52· minime accipienda: ‘not
to be allowed ⁹. So πρόφασιν or σκῆψιν ἆτοδέχεσθαί τινος.

Ρ. 170—nos:=Romani‚ not simply Laelius and his sons-in·law.
—- maiorum: depends on spatio cum'culoque. Metaphors from
racing are common in Cicero; cf. e. g. Academ. 2, 112: C. M. 14, 33,
83. Cf. also below, 101. That there is little difference in meaning
between spatium and curriculum (here perhaps ‘course and career’)
is shown by passages like Orat. 12 Academiae spatia sunt curricula
multiplicium variorumque sermonum. Spatium refers rather to the
whole ground of the racc-course, curriculum to the track or portion
passed over in running. ·

41. regnum occupare: ‘ to establish a monarchy ¹. In Vell. Pater.
2, 4, 4 Scipio says of Ti. Gracchus ‘si occupandae rei publicae animum
habuisset ’. --’· vel: = vel potius. is quidem: == ἑκεΐνός γε, οι·
ὅ γε as in Homer; not needed for the sense, but added in order to
point attention more closely to the subject of the verb. — audierat:
the modern equivalent for hearing of such a matter would be reading
about it in history. So the Greeks say ἀκούομεν ‘we know from his-
tory'; ἆνήκοος ‘a man ignorant of history '. P. Scipione: P.
Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapi0, the murderer of Ti. Gracchus. He
is sometimes called ponti ex (e. g. in Cat. ¹, 3) to distinguish him from
Africanus, but in other passages merely Ρ. Scipio as here; cf. Leg.
3, 203 Plane. 88. His father is mentioned in 101. Nasica Serapio
