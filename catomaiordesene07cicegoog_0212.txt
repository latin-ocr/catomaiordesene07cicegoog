44 NOTES To LAELmS. [2-

often joined with expressions relating to time, when the time is not
fixed with absolute exactness. So Cic. Rep. 2, 56 decem fere annis ,-
Pis. 13 quinta fere hora ; Caes. Β. G. 4, 23, 1 tertia fere vt‘gv‘lia. The
Greek expressions ὣς ἔπος εἰπεῖν, ὣς εἰπεῖν (which have a verbal re—
semblance to the Latin phrase ut ita dicam, but do not resemble it in
meaning) cor-respond very closely to fere. — multis erat in ore:
Cic. uses both constructionS, esse in ore alti-ui and esse in ore alicuius.
-- Ρ. Sulpicio: Sulpicius was originally on the side of the aris„
tocracy, but being plebeian tribune in 88 Β. e. he became a tool of
Marius and proposed some revolutionary laws. His former friend
Pompeius was consul and vigorously opposed him. In a fight the
son of Pompeius was slain, afterwards Sulla entered the city with an
army and Sulpicius was killed. — utebare multum: ‘you were
much in the society of...'—tribunus: See A. 1843 G. 3243 H.
363, 3, 2). - capitali odio: ‘deadly hatred’. The same phrase
occurs in a fragm. of Cic. (Baiter, xm. 1, 2); cf. also Hor. Sat. 1, 7,
13 ira capitales. -— quocum: so 15 and 77, but in 22 quicum. Qum
cum is commonly used when some particular and specified person is
meant, as here and 15, quicum when the statement is general and the
person undefined, as in 22. The MSS„ however, vary so much be-
tween the two forms that it is often difficult to decide concerning
them. -- querella: the spelling querella seems better attested than
querela. Cf. Roby, 177, 2. ’

3. eam...mentionern: see n. on 2 eum sermonem. The reference
is of course to the fact that Sulpicius had turned against his former
friend. This led Scaevola to the general subject of friendship.

P. 2.- C. Fannio: see Introd. C. is an abbreviation for Gmus,
not CAnJS, the latter form of the name having been absolutely un-
known to the Romans of the Republic and early Empire. It appears
in an inscription (Vol. 111. No. 1178 of Mommsen's Corpus) of the
time of Caracalla. On the other hand, it is not uncommon to find in
modern books the abbreviation written G. instead of C. (e. g. in Ger-
lach’s edition of Sallust throughout, and occasionally in R. Ellis' Ca·
tullus3 so Kiihner, Gram. 1, ed. 2, p. 708 ‘C. oder G. Gaius '). But
the Romans always wrote C. not G. In very early times the Latin
alphabet contained no letter G, and the letter C represented two dis-
tinct sounds, the guttural tenuis and the guttural media. After the
introduction of G the Romans still kept up the old fashion of writing
C. for Gaius and Cn. for Gnaeus; so they wrote K. for Caeso. See
