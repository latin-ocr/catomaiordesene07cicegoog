PREFACE.

indicate by some mark the matter due to himself 3 but
as this could hardly be done without marring the appear—
ance of the page, and thus introducing a source of con-
fusion to the student, it was not attempted. In the work
of revision free use of the principal German and English
editions has been made.

To some the notes of the present edition may appear
too copious. The aim throughout, however, has been not
simply to give aid on difficult points, but to call attention
to the finer usages of the Latin, and to add also whatever
explanation seemed necessary to a clear understanding of
the subject-matter. Latin scholarship which shall be at
the same time broad and accurate, including not only a
mastery of the language but also a comprehensive view of
the various phases of Roman life and thought, will, it is
believed, be best assured by the slow and careful reading
of some portions of the literature and by the rapid survey
of otherS. Certainly of the shorter Latin classics few would
more fully repay close and careful study of both language
and thought than these charming colloquies on Old Age
and F riendship. While almost faultless in expression, they
embody in a remarkable degree that universal element which
characterizes the literary masterpiece, and makes it the
valued possession not merely of an age or a nation, but
‘of all time.
