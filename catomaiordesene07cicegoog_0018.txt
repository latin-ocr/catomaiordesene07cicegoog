logue was a common rhetorical device, especially in the presen-
tation of abstruse subjectS. The introduction of characters to
conduct the discussion gave vividness and clearness to the un-
folding of the argument, as well as a kind of dramatic interest to
the production. In the Cato Μειίοι·1 and the Laelius, as gener-
ally, Cicero followed the plan of Aristotle’s dialogues (now lost)
rather than that of the dialogues of Plato. In the former there
was more of exposition and less of discussion than in the latter3
one person stated his views on some question, and the company
in attendance only made occasional remarks without attempting
to debate the question. In the latter, although one person, Soc-
rates, is everywhere prominent, others are continually drawn
into the discussions, and there is a quick interchange of ques-
tion and answer. The Aristotelian form was better adapted to

Cicero’s purposes than the Platonic3 the progr-ess of the argu-
ment. was less interrupted‚ and thus better opportunity for a
symmetrical development ot' the theme was afforded. Then,
too, the former was more popular. The style of Aristotle ² had
been imitated by Theophrastus and many other writers down
to Cicero’s time, while that of Plato had found hardly any
imitators.

The editors of the Cato Maior bave generally assumed that
Cicero attempted to give an antique coloring to the diction of
the dialogue in order to remind readers of Cato’s own style. It
is only necessary to read a page or two of Cato’s De Re Rustica
to have this illusion dispelled. The only things actually alleged
to be archaisms are (1) the use of deponent participles as pas-
sives in 55 4, 59, 74, a thing common enough in Cicero; (2) the
occurrence of quasi = quem ad modum in 5 71 3 (3) of audaciter
:audacter in 5 72; (4) of tuerentur for intuerentur in 5 77;
(5) of neutiquam in 5 423 (6) of the nominative of the gerun-
dive governing an accusative case in 56. In every instance the
