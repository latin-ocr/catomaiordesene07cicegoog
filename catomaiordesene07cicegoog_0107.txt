24] NOTES To CATO MAIOR. 71

the first rank of philosophers ’. — Pythagoran: neither the date of
his birth nor that of his death can be determined3 he ‘flourished'
about 530. He lived mostly in the Greek settlements of lower Italy,
where his school existed for some centuries after his death. — De-
mocritum: of Abdera, one of the originators of the theory of atoms;
said to have lived from 460 to 361 or 357 B.C. — Xenocraten:
after Plato, Speusippus was the first head of the Academic School;
Xenocrates succeeded him. He lived from 397 to 315 or 313. —
Zenonem : of Citium in CypruS, founder of Stoicism, born about 357 ,
is said to have lived to the age of 98. — Cleanthen: he followed
Zeno in the presidency of the Stoic school. His age at death is vari-
ously given as 99 and as 80 years. —·—· quern vidistis: see Introd.
It is rather curious that Cic. should make Cato speak with admiration
of DiogeneS, to whom he had shown great hostility. — Diogenen:
Cic. probably wrote in -an. ·en, not in -am, -em the accusatives of
Greek proper names in -as, -es. Stoicum: to distinguish him
from Diogenes the Cynic. — agitatio: Cic. uses agitatio and actio
almost interchangeably; cf. agitatio rerum in De Or. 3, 88 with actio
rerum iu Acad. 2, 62 and elsewhere. Actus iu this sense occurs only
in silver Latin.

24. age: a common form of transition to a new subject; brief for
‘hoc age ', ‘ do this ’, i. e. ⁸ attend to this that Ι am going to say ’. The
common use of ἄγε in Greek is exactly similar. —- ut . . . omittamus:
Cf. n. on 52 ut. — possum nominare: ‘1 am able to name'; in
colloquial English ‘I might name ’. The Latins occasionally use also
a hypothetical form, where possim or possem stands in the apodosis of

 

- a conditional sentence, the protasis of which is not expressed3 but the

missing protasis is generally easily' supplied ancl was distinctly pres-
ent to the writer’s mind. E. g. in Tusc. 1, 88 we have dici hoc in te
non potest ‚· posset in Tarquinio ‚· at in mortuo ne intellegi quidem
(potest), where the reason for the change from potest to posset is quite
evident. In translating from English into Latin it is far safer to use
the indicative. Cf. 55 possum persequi. A. 311, c; G. 599, Rem. 33
H. 511, 1, n. 3, 476, 4. ex agro...Romanos: ‘country-bred
Romans (i. e. Roman citizens) belonging to the Sabine district ’- The
words ex agro Sabino form an attributive phrase qualifying Romanos
just as rustt‘cos does, numquam fere: ‘ scarcely ever ’. ma-
iora opera: ‘farm work of any importance'. This use of opera is
common in Vergil’s Georgics. -- non: the repetition of the nega-
