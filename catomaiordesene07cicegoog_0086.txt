—‘1 will grant your request because 1 have often heard complaints
about old age and therefore have thought of the matter ³. —pares
autem etc.: parenthetical. vetere proverbio: the saying is as
old as Homer, Od. 17, 218 ὥς αἰεὶ τὸν ὁμοῖον ἄγει θεὸς ὥς τὸν ὁμοῖον,
cf. also Plat.. Rep. 329 Α, Symp. ¹95 B, Phaedr. 24ο c.

meaning of the word in Cic„ e. g. Fam. 2, 16, 2 in maritimi.»- facillime

kind of explanation of querellas:—‘ lamentationS, viz. such utterancoe

616, 3, 1.; H. 445, 5. C. Salinator: probably C. Livius Salinator,
praetor in 191 Β. c. (Livy 35. 24), who was entrusted with the equip-
ment of the Roman fleets during the war against Antiochus. He was
born about 230, and was therefore a little younger than Cato; cf. sere
aequales below. Salinator was consul in 188, and died in 170. Α For
the name Salinator cf. n. on 11.——·Sp. Albinus: Sp. Postumius
Albinus was consul in 186, and was with his colleague appointed to
investigate the great Bacchanalian conspiracy of that year (Livy 39,
cc. ι seq.). Albinus died in 180. He was probably a little younger
than Salinator. He can scarcely have been fifty years of age at his
death. -— tum . . . tum: ⁸ now . . . again ’ς so in 45. —- carerent:

have meant merely ‘that one thing which was matter for complaint'.
A. 3²03 G. 634, Rem. 13 H. 503, Ι. usu venirent: the phrase
usu venire differs very little in meaning from accidere. Usu is com-
monly explained as an ablative (‘in practice ’, ‘in experience ’), but is
quite as likely to be a dative of the sort generally called predicative
(‘to corne as matter of experience'); cf. Verg. Aen. 1, 22 venire ex·
