46 NOTES TO CATO MAIOR. [4

ι

 

a3 G. 633, 6343 H. 503, I. quo in genere: sc. rer-unu with this

phrase the defining genitive is commonly omitted by Cicero. So

below, 45 in eo genere. -- ut . . . adeptam: notice the chiasmus. —- ·

eandem: idem is used in the same way, to mark an emphatic contrast,
in 24, 52, 68, 71. -- adeptam: this is probably the only example in
Cicero of the passive use of adeptus, which occurs in Sallust, Ovid,
Tacitus, etc.; and in this passage the use cannot be looked on as cer-
tain, since one of the very best and several of the inferior MSS. read
adepti. Cicero, however, uses a good many deponent participles in a
passive sense (cf. below, 59 dimensa ,·-74 meditatum ,· see also a list,
Roby, 734), and some of them occur very rarely. Thus periclitatus,
arbitratus, depastus as passives are found each in only one passage.
— inconstantia: ‘instability ⁹, ‘inconsistency'. Constantia, unwa-
vering firmness and consistency, is the characteristic of the wise man3
cf. Acad. 2, 23 sapientia. . .quae ex sese habeat constantiam ,· also Lael.
8 and 64. .

P. 3. '— aiunt: sc. stulti. -—- putassent: the subjunctive is ducto
the indirect discourse. Where we say ‘I should not have thought,'
the Latius say, in direct narration, ‘non putaram‚' i. e. ‘1 never had
thought’ (so Off. 1, 81 and often in Cicero’s letters). Translate, ‘ more
quickly than they had ever expected ². Cf. Att. 6, 1, 6 accipiam equi-
dem dolorem mihi illum irasci sed multo maiorem non esse eum talem
qualem putassem. See Zump‘t, Gram., 518. —falsum putare:
‘to form a mistaken judgment'. For falsum as noun equivalent to
ψεῦδος, cf. 6 gratis-simum ,· also n. on 3 ceterir. qui citius · lit. ‘ in
what way quicker '; cf. Tusc. 5, 89 qui melius. H. 188, 11. 2. -—-‚a'du-
lescentia . . . senectus . . . pueritia ε boyhood was generally at Rome
supposed to last till the 17th year (the time for assuming the toga
virilis and for beginning military service). Iuventus is usually the age
from 17 to 45, during which men were liable to be called on for active
service. Ordinarily, in colloquial language, adulescentia is the earlier

portion of iuventus, say the years from 17 to 30 (cf. 33), but Cicero
seems here to make adulescentia co-extensive with iuventus. From 4 5

to 60 is the aetas seniorum, the period during which citizens in early
Rome might be called out for the defence of the city, but not for active
service. Senectus was commonly reckoned as beginning at 60 ς but in
§60 Cicero includes in senectus the aetas seniorum, and probably in·
tended to include it here. In Tusc. 1, 34 Cic. reckons three ages pue·
ritia adulescentia senectus as here3 below in 74, four periodS, or five·
