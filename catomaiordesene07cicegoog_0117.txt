assueverat serre, taurum serebat. As to Milo see n. on 27. For acm
sustineret a modern would have been inclined to use a participle,
which was perhaps avoided here because of the close proximity oi
another participle, ingressus. —umeris : this spelling is better than
humeris, which is now abandoned by the best scholare». There is no
sound corresponding to the h in words of the same origin in cognate
languages (see CurtiuS, Greek Etym. 1, 4²3 of the Eng. Trans.), and
although undoubtedly h was wrongly attached to some Latin wordS‚
there is no evidence to show that this happened to umerus. -—— has:
i. e. Milonis, corresponding to Pythagorae. Pythagorae: chosen
no doubt because tradition made Milo a Pythagoream see ιι. on 27.
. — malis: i. e. si optandum sit (cf. Plaut. Miles 170). For the ellipsis
