102 NOTES To LAELIUS. [76-

scelus in Verg. Aen. 6, 742. —— ut Catonem dicere audivi: ‘as Ι
have been told Cato used to say ⁹, not ‘ as 1 have heard Cato say ’
which would require decentem or cum diceret. See ref. on C. M. 3
admirantis. — dissuendae etc.: cf. off. 1, 120 amicitias magi-s· de·
cere censent sapientes sensim diluere quam repente praecidere ‚· below, 78
exstinctae potius quam oppresme. Observe mogh in the one place and
pothcs in the other, for which cf. n. on ²7· — exarserit: from exar-
descere, the verb exardere occurring only in very late Latin, as in the
Vulgate. The metaphorical use is exceedingly common in Cicero;
cf. ²9- — statim: cf. Aristot. Eth. Nic. 9, 3, 2.

77. aut morum aut studiorum. the first aut corresponds to aut
before in rei publicae. It is exceedingly likely that the second aut
should be changed into et,· cf. 74 morum studiorumque. — commu-
tatio.. ..solet 33 mutari ea'am mores hominum saepe. — in rei
publicae partibus: a. e. in connection with politica] parties’ . —
communibusz=volgar23us in 76. —- Q. Pompei etc.': the grand-
father of the Pompeius mentioned in ²3 hc raised himself to thc con·
sulship as a novus homo in 141 B. c.· (Brut. 963 Verr. 5, 181). Laelius
was a candidate and Pompeius was said to have promised Scipio that
he would not stand himself but support Laelius. —— Metello: i. e.
Macedonico, the praetor of 148, who commanded in Greece till 146,
when he returned and was the leader of the anti-Scipionic party. The
quarrel, which was very famouS, began with the despatch of Mummius,
who was connected with the Scipios, to command in Achaia. Metel·
lus became consul in 143 after two failureS, and commanded against
Viriathus. In 131 he was censor and lived till ιι 5. He was an augur3
hence collega of Laelius. — et: this does not correspond with ac, but
graviter ac moderate go together and form one expression. Et and ac
do not correspond in Cic.; cf. n. on 75 mollisque.

78. quam ob rem iniuriam: these sentences summarize and
emphatically repeat the sense of the two preceding sections. — ut
exstinctae etc.: cf. C. M. 71.

P. 80. - quae: agrees with the last only of the three words iur-
gia, maledicta, contumeliae. —- honos . .. tribuendus: so Aristot.
Eth. Nic. 9, 3, 5. — omnino: here = ‘ to sum up ⁸ ; ‘looking at the
matter as a whole ’. —- una cautio est: for the form of expression
cf. Acad. 2, 51 omnium inanium mirorum una depulsio est. In both
passages the verbal noun in -tio conveys the notion of possibility.
ut ne: see n. on 42. -- non dignos: put for indignos, appar·
ently because of dtjgm' autem following.
