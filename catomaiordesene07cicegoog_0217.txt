7] NOTEs To LAELrUs. 49

cognomen is applied to the inherited third name Cato and to the ac·
quired name sapiens. In late Latin agnomen was applied to the
latter to mark the distinction.

7. te...esse sapientem: this clause was· intended to depend on
emktimant below, but owing to the great length of the sentence Cic.
made a pause at iudicatum, and repeated the gist of the sentence
down to that point in the words ham-...sapientiam which depend
on exzktimant. The sentence is an example of anacoluthon. —
non solum . . . doctrinae here natura denotes the intellectual endow·
ments with which a man is born, and mores his natural char'acten
cf. 27. Studium or devotion to the pursuit of learning depends
on mores, doctrina or attainment on this combined with natura. The
two words natura and mores together comprise the natural endow·
ments of a man, while studium and doctrina indicate his acquire·
ments. Cf. Acad. 1, 203 Arch. 15. Studio et doctr-tm ‘by devotion
and culture’; not a case of hendiadys. Cf. n. on C. M. 15 iuven-
tute et viribus,· De Or. 1, 22 ; Arch. 3. ——- reliqua: this word is
proleptic or anticipative, since its sense is not fully seen till we come
to Athenis which completes the contrast. So ceteras is often used,
and λοιπός, ἄλλος in Greek. — septem: ‘the seven ', sapientes
being understood, as in 59. So ΧΠ alone often stands for ΧΗ tabu-
lae (Leg. 2, 5'9, 60),> and Asinius Pollio has (in Cic. Fam. 10, 32, 2)
XIV for xlv ordines. subtilius: ‘with more than usual accu-
racy ’. Subtt'ltlr is often the exact equivalent of the Greek ἀκριβής.
——- non habent: Cic. in Off. 3, 16 denies the title sapiens not only
to the seven, but t0.Cato and to Laelius himself. unum: em-
phatic: ‘one only ’, i. e. Socrates. Cic. nearly always leaves the
English ‘ only ’ unexpressed, but occasionally he uses modo, and once
(Acad. 2, 74) tantum. ——- et eum quidem: these words add em·
phasis to sapientissimum ; cf. 4 et eorum and n. ——- Apollinis
iudicatum: Socrates in Plato’s Apology, p. 21 Α merely says that
the oracle declared that no one was wiser than himself (μηδένα σοφώ-
τερον εἶναι). The person who put the inquiry to the oracle,· Chae-
rephon, a pupil of Socrates, was dead when the trial took place, but
his brother bore evidence to the facts. Xenophon in his Apology,
ξ 14 (if it be his) makes Socrates speak more definitely about the
oracles — ἀνεῖλεν ὁ Ἀπόλλων μηδένα εἶναι ἀνθρώπων epea μήτε έλεν·
&pacha-‘pov μήτε δικαιότερον μήτε σωφρονέστερον. In another part of
the Apology by Plato (33 c) Socrates says that the life he followed
